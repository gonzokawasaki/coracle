# AMAdocs — Developer Notes

Technical companion to `K-base.md` (overview) and `AMAdocs-SPEC.md` (product spec). This is the
**engineering log** — newest entries on top, kept in chronological/archaeological order on purpose.

**Current state (2026-06-20):** AMAdocs is the semantic file-manager UI wired end-to-end to the
engine (live file tree, AI state chips, folder indexing, scoped chat, context-menu actions); the
"ride on GNOME" loop and safe ingest queue are proven live; the LanceDB schema bug is fixed and the
`teaching` table re-indexed. Three CSS skins (Terminal / Slate / Desktop) ship on top of the wired
UI. The **background cadence scheduler is now built** (resume-on-relaunch + periodic delta tick), and
**granite4.1:3b is blessed as the bundled default** (packaged env + summary fallback + catalog lead).
The **sparse-index mystery is solved and fixed** (see top entry): LocalSearch was skipping every `.git`
directory by default, so the whole `teaching_docs` vault was invisible — corpus now indexed. Preview is
client-side (PDF.js/mammoth/SheetJS, **+ marked.js for markdown** as of 2026-06-21), decoupled from
indexing (any local file previews from disk), and wide spreadsheets/markdown no longer bleed off the page. The app now **opens to a live status doc** (index/db/model/version). The **GNOME
extraction blind spots are now backstopped** (top entry): docx/xlsx/pptx that GNOME mis-routes, scanned
PDFs, and images now run through AMAdocs' own collector extractors and embed — folder sync handles office
docs + scanned PDFs automatically, right-click "analyse with AI" handles images (OCR + vision) on demand.
The **`p.N` citation label** is now restored for backstop PDFs (carry `asPDF`'s page ranges) and the
**dryRun over-count is fixed** (empty-text files route to the backstop instead of being phantom-counted)
— both 2026-06-21, verified live. The top-left **window-style dots are now real Home/Back/Forward nav
buttons** and the launch surface is a proper **Homepage** (status cards + indexed-folders + quick actions),
not the old read-only markdown status — both 2026-06-21, verified live in the Electron app. Open:
**packaging** only (stale AppImage, icon, Windows/macOS). The "Phase 1 / Phase 2" labels below are
historical build-stage names — the product is just AMAdocs now.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — Preview polish: markdown rendering + spreadsheet/markdown bleed fix

Three fixes to the document preview pane (`renderXlsxInto` / new `renderMarkdownInto`, and the
`.vsheet-page` family in `ui/index.html`), all verified live over CDP in the running Electron app:

- **`.md` files now render as formatted markdown** (were showing as raw source). Vendored **marked.js
  v12.0.2** (MIT, ~35 KB) into `ui/vendor/` (+ `tooling/amadocs-ui/vendor/`), alongside PDF.js/mammoth/
  SheetJS — fully offline, nothing fetched at runtime. New `renderMarkdownInto()` parses GFM (tables,
  task lists, fenced code) into a `.vsheet-page.md-body`, with a plain-text fallback if marked ever
  fails to load. Wired into all three dispatch paths: `renderFromDisk` (off-disk, by `.md/.markdown/
  .mdown/.mkd` ext or `text/markdown` mime), `renderOriginalInto` (indexed docs, by mime/docpath), and
  the citation-jump path. New `.md-body` CSS themes headings/lists/checkboxes/code/blockquotes/tables
  with the existing page CSS variables.
- **Wide spreadsheets no longer bleed off the page** (original report). `.vsheet-page.is-xlsx` is now a
  definite, content-independent width (`calc(100% - 2rem); max-width:64rem`) and each sheet's table is
  wrapped in `.xlsx-sheet { overflow-x:auto }`, so a too-wide grid scrolls **inside** the page instead
  of spilling past its right edge.
- **Wide markdown bleed (code blocks + tables)** got the same treatment: `.md-body` is given a definite
  width with `min-width:0` so wide children can't stretch the page via flex `min-content` sizing; `pre`
  is capped at `max-width:100%` with `overflow-x:auto`, and `table` uses `display:block; width:max-
  content; max-width:100%; overflow-x:auto` (the GitHub approach) to become its own horizontal scroll
  area. Long words/URLs wrap via `overflow-wrap:break-word`. **Root cause** (both md + xlsx): the fixed
  paper width didn't hold because flex `min-content` let content widen the page — the cure is a definite
  page width plus children capped at `max-width:100%` with internal scroll.

**Verified live:** README.md → formatted (h1/lists), DEV-NOTES.md → `pageBleeds:false` with the 1746 px
`pre` and 1955 px `table` scrolling internally; a wide grades `.xlsx` → page within the desk, table
scrolls inside. **Follow-up idea noted** (not built): opt-in per-mime preview renderers surfaced on the
Homepage — code viewer (syntax highlighting) for programmers, video player for filmmakers, etc.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — Browser-style UI zoom (Ctrl +/−/0 + Ctrl+wheel)

Zoom was effectively fixed: the window hides the native menu bar (`win.setMenuBarVisibility(false)`),
so the default View-menu zoom accelerators never ran and nothing drove Chromium's page zoom. Wired it
directly on the window's `webContents` in **`amadocs-desktop/main.js`** (new `setupZoom(win)`, called in
`createWindow` right after `setMenuBarVisibility`):
- **Keyboard** via `before-input-event`: Ctrl/Cmd + `+`/`=` (zoom in), `-`/`_` (out), `0` (reset). The
  handler calls `event.preventDefault()`, which also suppresses any default-menu zoom role → no
  double-stepping.
- **Ctrl + mouse wheel** via the `zoom-changed` event: Chromium applies the step, we clamp + resync the
  cached factor so the keyboard path continues from wherever the wheel left off.
- Clamped **0.5×–3.0×** in 0.1 steps (`clampZoom`); a `did-finish-load` handler **re-applies the factor
  after each load** (the loading.html → ui/index.html navigation otherwise resets it).
- Page zoom scales the **whole renderer** — the DOM context menus, the Homepage, file previews — which is
  what "zoom the menus" needs.

**Scope:** Electron-only (correct — the browser dev-stack already has native browser zoom). **Session-only:**
factor lives in memory, resets to 100% on restart; persisting across launches (write to a settings file)
is an easy follow-up, not done.

**Verified live (2026-06-21):** user confirmed Ctrl + zooms the UI in the running app. (Automated check
was inconclusive — CDP-injected synthetic keystrokes don't reliably reach Electron's `before-input-event`;
a temporary instrumented build proved `setZoomFactor` itself moves `devicePixelRatio`/`innerWidth` and that
the handler fires, then the human keypress settled it. Instrumentation removed; `node --check` clean.)

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — Strong-contrast pass on all three themes (faint text/boxes fixed)

User feedback: text and boxes were too faint against the background — "go for strong, not subtle, on all
items." Everything in the UI inherits from the per-theme CSS custom properties, so the fix was at the
variable layer (propagates to every box + text item at once). Edited **`tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`**
(source of truth) → synced identical to **`amadocs-desktop/ui/index.html`**. All three themes
(**dark**/default, **light**, **slate**):
- **Text** pushed toward max contrast: `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, and the near-invisible
  `--text-xfaint` (was a 0.40–0.45-alpha ghost → now a solid value).
- **Boxes:** `--border` strengthened dramatically (the main culprit for "faint boxes"); `--bg-hover`/
  `--bg-desk`/`--bg-sel` lifted for clearer panel separation; `--scrollbar-thumb` matched to the border.
- **Badges** (file-type chips): fill alpha ~doubled (0.10–0.16 → 0.20–0.30) with brighter fg.
- **Accents** (green/blue/amber/red) brightened a notch so links/"Connected ●"/warnings stand out.
- **Paper sheet** (Homepage + doc view render on a white `--page-bg`): darkened the fixed faint colours
  `.p-eye`/`.p-sub`/`.p-folio` + the shared `--page-faint`/`--page-p`/`--page-rule` for contrast on white.

Left intentionally faint: `.nav-btn:disabled { opacity:0.35 }` — that's the deliberate "Back/Forward
disabled at history ends" affordance. All changes are value swaps inside existing declarations (no
structural CSS change).

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — Homepage v1 + Home/Back/Forward nav buttons

Two linked pieces of the "lean on the homepage instead of menus" direction. **Lean v1 — we add cards/actions
as the product grows.**

**Top-bar nav (replaces 3 dead dots).** The top-left `.topbar__dot` spans looked like macOS traffic-lights
and did nothing. Replaced with three wired buttons (`.nav-btn`): **⌂ Home / ‹ Back / › Forward**. Backed by a
browser-style history stack (`navHist = {stack, idx, replaying}`) over the three middle-panel destinations
(Home status doc / folder / file preview). The trick: the three destination fns (`showStatusDoc` / `selectFolder`
/ `showFilePreview`) each call `pushHist()` up top, so **every** path into them is captured automatically without
touching each call site; Back/Forward replay via `navDispatch` with `replaying=true` so the replay doesn't
re-record, and re-selecting the same place is de-duped (`navEq`). Boot resets the stack after `initFileTree`
(which calls `selectFolder(home)` for its side-effects) so **Home is the history root** (Back disabled on first
load). `updateNavButtons()` toggles the disabled state at the ends.

**Homepage (repoints `showStatusDoc`).** The old launch surface rendered the server markdown read-only via
`renderStatusMd` (now unused but left in place; the on-disk `AMADOCS-STATUS.md` artifact still generates).
`showStatusDoc` now renders a structured HTML homepage (`renderHomeHtml`) inside the `.vsheet-page` paper sheet:
hero (◆ AMAdocs · version · tagline · generated-time + refresh), a 4-card status grid (**Index** GNOME
connected? · **Library** docs · workspaces · **Model** chat · provider · **Engine** version · Node · vectorDb),
an **Indexed folders** list (or empty-state hint), and **Quick actions** — three wired buttons:
`🗂 Browse my files` (`desktop.homePath`→`selectFolder`), `＋ Index a folder…` (`desktop.pickFolder`→`selectFolder`
→`onSyncFolder`), `⟳ Refresh status`. Active tab label is now `⌂ Home` (was `◆ AMAdocs Status`).

**Engine — `server/endpoints/workspaces.js`:** renamed `buildAmadocsStatusMarkdown()` → `buildAmadocsStatus()`,
which now computes a structured `data` object (engine/model/gnome/library/synced) **and** derives the markdown
from the same values, returning `{ markdown, data }`. The `/amadocs-status` endpoint serves both (`data` feeds
the homepage; `markdown` still writes the on-disk file + stays back-compat). No new data gathered — just exposed.

**Verified live (2026-06-21)** — real dev stack (server :3001 reloaded via nodemon, collector :8888, ollama),
Electron app (`--no-sandbox --remote-debugging-port=9222`, driven via `tooling/cdp.js`):
- `/api/amadocs-status` returns `data` (GNOME connected, 784 docs / 3 ws, granite4.1:3b, 1 synced folder).
- Clean page load lands on Home and **stays** (`navHist.stack ["home"], idx 0`); 4 cards + 3 actions + the synced
  folder all render from the live payload (screenshot `tooling/logs/homepage.png`).
- Back/Forward flow proven: Home → `🗂 Browse my files` (Back on, Fwd off) → `navBack` to Home (Back off, Fwd on)
  → `navForward` to the folder. Disabled-state toggling correct at both ends.
- `node --check` (workspaces.js) + `vm.Script` over both inline UI scripts: 0 failures. Source synced
  `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` → `amadocs-desktop/ui/index.html` (identical).

**Cosmetic nits left open:** (1) hero reads "◆ AMAdocs**v1.14.0**" with no space before the version chip — a
margin tweak. (2) The version shown (`v1.14.0`, Node 22) is the **AnythingLLM engine** version, not an AMAdocs
product version — surface a real product version when one exists.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — Preview decoupled from indexing: any local file previews from disk

Previously `showFilePreview()` only rendered a file if it was in `docIndex` (i.e. already embedded);
every un-indexed file hit the "Right-click → analyse with AI" placeholder. That conflated two distinct
things — **preview** ("let me see this file") and **indexing** ("make it searchable"). The renderers
(`renderPdfInto`/`renderImageInto`/`renderDocxInto`/`renderXlsxInto`) already operate on a `Blob`; the
only reason preview needed an index was that bytes were fetched via the engine's `doc-original?path=
<docpath>` (and a docpath only exists post-index). The Electron bridge had no filesystem-read, so the
UI had no other way to get the bytes. Fixed by adding one:

- **`amadocs-desktop/main.js`** — `read-file` IPC handler: `fs.readFile` → `{ok, data:<base64>, mime}`.
  Path-guarded (string + `isFile()`), **size-capped at 100 MB** (`too-large` error), ext→mime via a
  `PREVIEW_MIME` map (default `application/octet-stream`).
- **`amadocs-desktop/preload.js`** — exposes `readFile(path)` on `window.amadocs`.
- **`tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`** (→ cp `amadocs-desktop/ui/`):
  - `renderFromDisk(container, fsPath, name)` — reads bytes off disk, builds a `Blob`, dispatches by
    mime exactly like `renderOriginalInto` (PDF/image/docx/xlsx·csv), `text/*`+json → new
    `renderBlobTextInto` (blob `.text()` → escaped via `renderDocText`; `renderTextInto` couldn't be
    reused — it needs a docpath/engine), unknown binary → "no built-in preview" note.
  - `showFilePreview` — when not indexed but `desktop.readFile` exists → `renderFromDisk` (else the old
    placeholder, for the browser dev stack with no bridge).
  - `renderImageInto` — `if(!docpath) return;` after appending the image, so an un-indexed image shows
    raw (no bogus `doc-view?path=null` caption fetch).
  - Not-indexed summary card now reads "Not yet indexed — previewing from disk. Right-click → analyse
    with AI to make it searchable." (preserves the indexing discoverability the placeholder used to carry).

**Net UX:** preview works on **any** local file regardless of index state; indexing (caption/OCR/search)
stays opt-in. Slightly shifts the old "you must index to interact" model — intentional, user-approved.

**Verified live (2026-06-21)** — relaunched Electron (main-process change → full restart), CDP-driven:
`window.amadocs.readFile` present; a non-indexed `.txt` (`Design prompt for AI design.txt`) → renders
2,428 chars from disk (not the placeholder); a non-indexed PDF (`0500_m20_in_12.pdf`, a Cambridge IGCSE
paper) → **8 PDF.js canvases rendered straight from disk**, metastrip `indexed pending`, summary card
shows the new hint (screenshot `tooling/logs/disk-preview-pdf.png`). Zero console/server errors. Parse
checks: `node --check` on main.js + preload.js, vm.Script over both inline UI scripts (0 failures).

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — `p.N` citation labels for backstop PDFs (carry asPDF's page ranges)

Closed the "cosmetic `p.N` citation label for bridged docs" open item — **scope: backstop PDFs only**
(user-chosen Option A; the cheap, zero-regression half). Background: a citation chip shows `p.N` by
mapping the cited chunk's char-offset into a `pages` array (`[{page,start,end}]`) via the UI's
`matchPage()`. Normal collector PDFs build that array in `asPDF` (`collector/.../asPDF/index.js:44`);
bridged docs lost it. There are two bridged cases — **collector-backstop PDFs** (scanned / OCR'd /
empty-text), where `asPDF` *already computes* `pages` but `materializeViaCollector`→`buildDoc` **threw
it away**; and **GNOME-text PDFs** (`tinysparql`), where TinySPARQL hands us flat text with no page
boundaries (would require re-parsing the PDF — deliberately **not** done, to keep ride-on-GNOME intact).

**Fix (`server/utils/GnomeBridge/index.js`, ~5 lines):**
- `buildDoc(meta, text, source, pages = null)` — new `pages` param; emits `pages: Array.isArray(pages)
  ? pages : []`. It's a **disk-only doc-JSON field** read by `doc-view` (`endpoints/workspaces.js:1490`),
  **not** part of the LanceDB metadata schema (`withAmadocsSchema` only forces amadocsSource/sourceMime/
  sourcePath/pageCount/aiSummary) — so pages-bearing and page-less docs mix freely in one workspace
  (normal asPDF uploads already do). `[]` for GNOME flat text → `matchPage` returns null → chip shows no
  label, passage highlight unaffected.
- `materializeViaCollector` — reads `doc = res.documents[0]` and passes `doc.pages` into `buildDoc`. Since
  `backstopFile` (the right-click "analyse with AI" path) also routes through `materializeViaCollector`,
  on-demand analysed PDFs get labels too. Non-PDF extractors (mammoth/xlsx) omit `pages` → `[]`, correct
  (no page concept).

**Verified live (2026-06-21)** — real dev stack (server :3001 + collector :8888, granite, native ONNX
embedder) + the Electron app (`--no-sandbox --remote-debugging-port=9222`, driven via `tooling/cdp.js`):
1. Real gnome-sync drained the two newly-routed blind spots; the **83-page** scanned/OCR'd `Year 6 ICT
   Translated KNTT…pdf` embedded with a full `pages` array (83 ranges, 0→135969 chars = pageContent len).
2. `doc-view` serves all 83 ranges.
3. A scoped `stream-chat` against that PDF returned 4 sources; the **UI's own `matchPage`** resolved them
   to **p.11 / p.18** (Python port + then live in-app).
4. **In the Electron renderer:** the file-scoped REPL rendered citation chips labelled **`p.11` / `p.18`**;
   clicking `p.11` jumped the PDF preview to page 11 with the passage highlighted (screenshot
   `tooling/logs/citation-pN.png`). Server log clean (no errors). GNOME-text PDFs still show no label, by
   design.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-21) — dryRun over-count fixed: empty `plainTextContent` files no longer phantom-counted

Closed follow-up (1) from the "OBSERVED — cadence loop verified live" entry below: a `dryRun`
gnome-sync's `indexed`/`queued` counted files the real embed path skips, so the preview didn't match
what executed. Root cause (confirmed live on this box against `…/teaching_docs/ICT_MOET`): GNOME
sometimes stores an **empty-string** `nie:plainTextContent` for a file it mis-routed (here an `.xlsx`
and a scanned `.pdf`). Those files have the triple, so `queryFileList` matched them (24 rows) — but
`materialize`→`fetchText` returns `""` → `if (!text.trim()) return null` → they never embed (real
sync held at 22). And they were **also** excluded from `queryBlindSpots`, which used a bare
`FILTER NOT EXISTS { plainTextContent }` — the empty triple *exists*, so NOT EXISTS was false. Net:
counted-but-never-embedded phantoms, falling through **both** queries.

**Fix (2 SPARQL filters, `server/utils/GnomeBridge/index.js`):**
- `queryFileList` — added `FILTER(STR(?t) != "")` so it returns only **genuinely text-bearing** gnome
  files (24 → 22). dryRun's gnome-text count now matches what `materialize` actually embeds.
- `queryBlindSpots` — changed `FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?ie nie:plainTextContent ?anytext }` →
  `FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?ie nie:plainTextContent ?anytext . FILTER(STR(?anytext) != "") }`, so
  "no *usable* text" fires on empty-string text too. The 2 empty-text files (both backstop exts) now
  route to the **collector backstop** (officeparser for the xlsx, OCR for the scanned PDF) instead of
  vanishing — strictly better than just correcting the count: they actually embed now.

**Verified (2026-06-21)** — `node --check` passes; the exported query fns run directly against the live
LocalSearch daemon over D-Bus (no server/DB needed): on ICT_MOET, `queryFileList` 24→**22**,
`queryBlindSpots` 3→**5** (now incl. `ict_quiz_SA2.xlsx` + `Year 6 ICT…schools.pdf`), dryRun
`indexed` = **27, all with a real extraction path**. Probe confirmed exactly 2 files there carry an
empty `plainTextContent` — the two now reclassified. The delta/state/cap machinery is untouched (the
queries feed `current` the same way). Remaining inherent optimism: a scanned PDF whose OCR yields
nothing is still counted in `queued` — unavoidable without running the collector in dryRun.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-20 PM) — Collector backstop: GNOME's extraction blind spots now embed (docx + OCR/vision)

Closed the long-standing "ride on GNOME inherits GNOME's silent blind spots" gap (the docx/scanned-PDF/
image holes flagged repeatedly below). The sync path only ever embedded files GNOME had already extracted
text for (`nie:plainTextContent`), so **docx/xlsx/pptx that GNOME's OOXML extractor mis-routes** (the
WPS-mime sniffing bug — 175 recorded `"Document must begin with an element <book>"` failures on this box),
**scanned/image-only PDFs**, and **images** were invisible. This was also why right-click **"analyse with
AI" on an image was a dead end** — `ctxAnalyse` needed a `docpath`, but images are excluded from bulk
index and had no ingest route to ever get one. **Both were one root cause:** AMAdocs' own collector
extractors (`asDocx`→mammoth/officeparser, `asPDF`→OCR fallback `ocrPDF`, `asImage`→OCR + moondream
caption) existed but were never called from the sync path. Fix reuses them wholesale — **no new
extraction code.**

**Design split (user-chosen):** office docs (docx/xlsx/pptx) + scanned PDFs are backstopped
**automatically during folder ⟳ sync / cadence**; images are **on-demand only** via right-click
(vision captioning is heavy — keep it opt-in, matching the existing `⚡ analyse` UI for images).

**Engine — `server/utils/GnomeBridge/index.js`:**
- `buildDoc(meta, text, source)` — new `source` param tags `amadocsSource:"collector-backstop"` (vs the
  default `"tinysparql"`); both are flat text served in place via `doc-original`'s `sourcePath` fallback.
- `queryBlindSpots({folder,exclude})` — sibling of `queryFileList` but `FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?ie
  nie:plainTextContent ?t }` + a backstop-extension filter (`.docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.doc/.xls/.ppt/.pdf` —
  images deliberately NOT in bulk). Same `GROUP BY ?u + MAX(?m)` double-row guard.
- `materializeViaCollector(slug, url)` — runs `CollectorApi.parseDocument(name, {absolutePath})`
  (parse-only; `processSingleFile` honours `absolutePath`+`parseOnly` → **never trashes/stashes the
  user's real file**), takes `documents[0].pageContent`, builds the doc via `buildDoc(…, "collector-
  backstop")`. Falls back to `EXT_MIME` when GNOME has no node for the file.
- `runSync` folds blind spots into `current` = `queryFileList` ∪ `queryBlindSpots` via a `sourceByUrl`
  map; the EXECUTE loop dispatches `materialize` (gnome text) vs `materializeViaCollector` (collector).
  The whole delta/state/cap/finalize-on-confirm machinery + THE #1 RULE stay unchanged.
- `backstopFile(slug, fsPath, {userId})` — on-demand single-file path (accepts images too). **Idempotent
  by sourcePath:** removes any existing same-path workspace doc (via `Document.forWorkspace` →
  `removeDocuments`) before embedding, so re-analysing never leaves duplicate vectors. Clears the STOP
  pause (user-driven), and records office/PDF files that live under a synced folder into that folder's
  state (matching url) so the cadence won't re-embed them.

**Engine — `server/endpoints/workspaces.js`:**
- `POST /workspace/:slug/analyse-file { path }` — thin wrapper over `backstopFile` (mirrors the
  `gnome-sync` wrapper). The right-click "analyse with AI" path for images / image-only PDFs.
- Generalized the `doc-original` in-place fallback from `amadocsSource === "tinysparql"` →
  `amadocsSource && sourcePath`, so backstop docs are first-class for preview + the citation loop.

**UI — `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` (source of truth) → `cp` `amadocs-desktop/ui/index.html`:**
- `analyseFile(entryPath)` helper (`POST …/analyse-file`).
- `ctxAnalyse` rewired: if the file already has a `docpath` → existing `deepSearchDoc` ("re-analyse");
  **else → `analyseFile()`** (was a dead-end toast). Both branches got a `setTimeout(refreshAiState,
  4000)` follow-up so the chip/dot reliably flips (the workspace doc list lags the embed by a beat).

**⚠️ Bug found + fixed mid-verify — duplicate vectors when on-demand + cadence both hit one file.** A
manual `analyse-file` and a cadence sync both embedded the same docx (the on-demand path had no dedup),
leaving two workspace docs for one `sourcePath`. Fix = the sourcePath-idempotency in `backstopFile`
above; re-analysing now collapses any duplicates to one. (Narrow residual: a special-char path where
`pathToFileUrl`'s encoding differs from GNOME's url could miss the state-dedup and let the cadence
re-embed once — self-heals on the next analyse.)

**Verified live (2026-06-20 PM) on this GNOME box** — real engine (granite, native ONNX embedder,
collector), driven by curl + CDP (`tooling/cdp.js`) against the running Electron app:
- **docx:** `…/ICT_MOET/VTA_Term3_week1_10_MrKieron_ICT.docx` (a recorded GNOME `<book>` failure) →
  mammoth extracted **5,352 words / 37,009 chars** → embedded; scoped `stream-chat` answered "the teacher
  is Kieron ODonnell" with **all sources attributed to that docx** (scopePath pre-filter working).
- **image:** right-click → "analyse with AI" on a fresh `.jpeg` flipped its chip **`⚡ analyse → ✓ deep`**
  (dot on) in ~12s in the live renderer, via the real `ctxAnalyse` handler.
- **doc-original** streams backstop docx (122 KB) + image (2.8 MB) in place (HTTP 200, correct MIME).
- **No duplicates:** dedup collapsed a 2→1 dup and a re-sync didn't re-create it — **0 duplicate
  sourcePaths workspace-wide** (28 docs / 28 unique paths).
- **dryRun** on ICT_MOET now *sees* the blind spots (`indexed` 24→27); they embed for real instead of
  being phantom-queued.

**⚠️ Caveats:** (1) ~~**moondream is NOT pulled on this box** (only granite) → image *captioning* is
skipped; only OCR text lands.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-20:** `moondream:latest` (1.7 GB) pulled; captioning
live. Re-verified end-to-end via the `VisionCaption` module against `tooling/test-docs/test-graphic.png`
(model `moondream`, basePath `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, 334-char caption — correctly read the yellow
circle / green rectangle / red triangle / blue sky). For good photo/diagram/whiteboard search this is now
on by default; a fresh box still needs `ollama pull moondream`. (2)
`removeDocuments` leaves orphan document-JSON files under `storage/documents/gnome-<slug>/` (harmless —
not workspace docs, no vectors). (3) The dryRun text-less over-count (below) is still open — but it now
over-reports *less*, since the blind-spot office/PDF files it counts genuinely embed.

## 🔎 OBSERVED (2026-06-20 PM) — cadence loop verified live; dryRun `queued` over-counts text-less files

Booted the dev stack (server :3001 + collector :8888; the upstream React frontend :3000 fails with
`cross-env: not found` — not installed, and we don't ship it, so benign) and the Electron app
(`electron . --no-sandbox`, reusing the running stack; chrome-sandbox still not SUID-root on this box).
Verified the **"ride on GNOME" indexing loop is live and current**:
- **GNOME OS index is warm** — `localsearch status` = idle, **2511 files / 940 folders** (well past the
  earlier 32; the `.git`-ignore fix from the entry below is holding).
- **Cadence scheduler ran this boot** — logged `[gnome-cadence] started — resume in 8s, tick every 15m`,
  and the resume pass actually fired (server up 15:42:27 → `storage/gnome-sync/amadocs-library.json`
  rewritten 15:42:42, the ~8s resume). One folder tracked: `…/teaching_docs/ICT_MOET` → `amadocs-library`.
- **That folder is fully in sync** — GNOME has extractable text for **22** files there; all **22** are
  embedded (22 doc JSONs, 22 workspace docs, 2.4M LanceDB table). 22/22, steady state.

**⚠️ Finding — `dryRun` `queued`/`indexed` counts include text-less files the real embed path skips.**
A `dryRun` gnome-sync on `ICT_MOET` perpetually reports `indexed:24, queued:2`, but a real sync embeds
**0** and holds at 22 (`tracked:22`). Not a stall: of the **31** files GNOME knows in that folder, only
**22 have `nie:plainTextContent`** — the real path queries for text, gets none for those 2, and correctly
skips them. The 2 phantom "queued" files are the known **`.docx` extraction failures** (GNOME's
"Document must begin with an element (e.g. <book>)" — here `Semester Plan ICT…docx` + `VTA_Term3…docx`).
So the dryRun preview count is misleading (over-reports by the count of text-less GNOME entries) even
though actual indexing is correct and complete. **Two follow-ups:** (1) make the dryRun `queued`/`indexed`
count only text-bearing files so the preview matches what executes; (2) the root cause is the GNOME docx
blind spot AMAdocs' own parser/OCR is *meant* to backstop — that backstop isn't wired into the gnome-sync
path, so those docx stay invisible. Neither is a regression; the cadence loop itself is correct.

## ✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-20) — sparse index = the `.git` ignore rule; preview not broken; status doc shipped

Follow-up to the "OBSERVED" entry below — all three threads closed in one session.

**(1) The index wasn't incomplete — it was excluded.** After idling, the count was still stuck at 32
files / 14 with text. Root cause: GNOME Tracker's default
`gsettings org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files ignored-directories-with-content` = `['.trackerignore',
'.git', '.hg', '.nomedia']` → **any directory containing `.git` is skipped, recursively.** `teaching_docs`
is a git+Obsidian vault, so the entire tree (973 files: 424 pdf, 196 md, 101 docx…) was ignored. Non-git
dirs (Downloads, Documents top-level) indexed fine, which is why it looked "thin" not "off." The
`localsearch status` failure list (9 docx `<book>` errors) is **stale/irrelevant** — those paths had 0
live entries; the docx extractor actually works fine on them when run directly (`localsearch extract`
pulls full `nie:plainTextContent`). **This is a real "ride on GNOME" blind spot:** the target audience
(developers, Obsidian users) keep docs inside git repos/vaults that LocalSearch ignores by default.

**Fix applied (user-approved):**
```
gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files ignored-directories-with-content "['.trackerignore', '.nomedia']"
gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files ignored-directories "['po','CVS','core-dumps','lost+found','node_modules','.git','.svn','dist','build','.cache','.venv','__pycache__','.next','vendor']"
systemctl --user restart localsearch-3.service
```
The first un-skips git repos; the second (ignore-**by-name**) keeps `.git` internals and `node_modules`
out — needed because dropping `.git` from with-content pulled in **124,386** node_modules files. After the
~45s purge: **14 → 901 files with extractable text**, teaching_docs **0 → 973 (804 with text)**,
node_modules → 0. Settings persist in dconf. (For non-GNOME builds later, this argues for AMAdocs' own
watcher+extractor over OS-default behavior.)

**(2) Document preview was never broken — and never used LibreOffice.** It's 100% client-side: `doc-original`
streams the file → UI dispatches by mime → PDF.js / mammoth.browser.min.js / xlsx.full.min.js (all bundled
in `vendor/`), else text fallback. Verified the engine side healthy (`doc-original` 200 + correct MIME;
`doc-view` good JSON) and rendered a real docx live in Electron via CDP (rich mammoth HTML, no error). It
*looked* broken because `showFilePreview()` only renders when the file is in `docIndex`, which is built from
the **amadocs-library** workspace — and that workspace was **empty** (0 docs). Every tree file therefore hit
the "Right-click → analyse" placeholder. Indexed `ICT_MOET` (24 files) via `gnome-sync` → `loadDocIndex()` →
docIndex.size 22 → previewing a real `.docx` rendered correctly. **Resolution: index content (now unblocked
by fix #1); no code change to the preview path.**

**(3) Status doc shipped (read-only v1).** The app now opens to a live `AMADOCS-STATUS.md` in the preview
pane (user's idea — keep config/status out of the chrome). New `GET /api/amadocs-status` in
`server/endpoints/workspaces.js` → `buildAmadocsStatusMarkdown()` gathers workspaces+doc counts, GNOME
status + synced folders, model/embedder, engine/Node version → writes `storage/AMADOCS-STATUS.md` → returns
`{markdown}`. UI adds `renderStatusMd()`/`mdInline()` (handles `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `- lists`) +
`showStatusDoc()` wired last in BOOT; `.status-doc` CSS. Source `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` cp'd →
`amadocs-desktop/ui/`. Verified rendering live. **Deferred to v2:** interactive config controls (radio/toggle
for model, cadence, deep-vs-catalog) — Markdown can't do interactive widgets, but our Electron DOM can; needs
a widget-capable status renderer. **Live-app diagnosis recipe used:** launch `amadocs-desktop` electron with
`--no-sandbox --remote-debugging-port=9222` (reuses running :3001 stack), drive with `node tooling/cdp.js
eval '<js>'`.

## 🔎 OBSERVED (2026-06-20) — the OS index on this GNOME box is sparse so far (core-bet reality check)

First real look at what LocalSearch has actually extracted on this Ubuntu/GNOME box (the move's whole
premise — "ride on a warm OS index"). Drove the live app fine end to end (live tree, AI-state chips,
folder/file REPL scope, both Desktop + Terminal skins — screenshots taken), but the **index itself is
thin**:

- **Daemon up, idle.** `localsearch-3` running; `localsearch status` → *"Indexer is idle"*, scope
  `index-recursive-directories = ['$HOME']` (single-dirs empty). D-Bus reachable, `GnomeBridge.available()`
  = true.
- **Only 32 files / 72 folders indexed**, of which **just 14 have extractable text**
  (`nie:plainTextContent`) — and 14 is *all AMAdocs currently has to ride on*. That's a tiny fraction of
  a real `$HOME` (the `teaching_docs/` corpus alone is hundreds of docs) → the crawl is **incomplete**,
  not warm yet. (Idle-aware: it defers; leaving the box idle for a few hours should let it deepen.)
- **~169 recorded extraction failures**: 155 `.mts` (AVCHD video — no text extractor, expected/benign),
  **9 `.docx`** failing with `"Could not open: Error on line 1 char 1: Document must begin with an
  element (e.g. <book>)"` (a parser error in LocalSearch's docx path), 4 `.xls`, 1 `.png`. The `.docx`
  failures are a **genuine blind spot** — exactly the seam AMAdocs' own parser/OCR is meant to cover,
  and notable because `teaching_docs/` is `.docx`-heavy.

**Plan:** leave the machine idling a few hours, then re-check `localsearch status` + the text-bearing
count (`SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?u)) WHERE { ?ie nie:plainTextContent ?t ; nie:isStoredAs ?do . ?do nie:url ?u }`).
If it stays stuck at ~32, the crawl needs a nudge (`localsearch index --recursive ~/Documents`) or the
`.docx` extractor needs investigating. **This is the core bet's freshness/coverage question made real —
track it.**

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-20) — Granite blessed as the bundled default (was phi3.5)

`granite4.1:3b` (IBM, Apache-2.0) is now the default chat model everywhere, not just in
`.env.development`. Granite stays on-source far more cleanly than phi3.5 — it doesn't leak the
`Context N` chunk-scaffolding that `stripScaffolding`/`capAnswer` have to claw back (4/12 answers on
phi3.5; see the verbosity log below), so blessing it removes the product's most visible rough edge.
Three spots that still hard-coded phi3.5:
- **`amadocs-desktop/main.js` → `packagedEngineEnv()`** — `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF: "phi3.5"` → `"granite4.1:3b"`.
  This is the real "bundled default": dev reads `.env.development` (already granite), but the packaged
  app passes env explicitly, so this was the one place a shipped build still defaulted to phi3.5.
- **`server/utils/collectorApi/index.js`** — the doc-summary model fallback `"phi3.5"` → `"granite4.1:3b"`
  (only hit when neither `SUMMARY_MODEL_PREF` nor `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF` is set; matches the blessed default).
- **`server/endpoints/workspaces.js` → `AMADOCS_MODEL_CATALOG`** — granite moved to the **lead** entry,
  tagged `default:true` + "· the default" in its blurb; phi3.5 demoted below phi4-mini and relabelled
  "Older balanced all-rounder" (no longer "the default"). The first-run download overlay pulls the
  catalog's `default:true` entry, so it now fetches granite. (Catalog stays an MIT/Apache allowlist.)

The Phase 2 UI hard-codes no model (the model picker was a Phase 1 feature, not yet re-wired), and the
library workspace is left unpinned (`ensureLibraryWorkspace` sets only `chatMode:"query"`), so it
inherits the system default — i.e. granite — with nothing else to change. `OLLAMA_MODEL_TOKEN_LIMIT`
left at 4096 (safe/conservative; granite handles far more). `node --check` on the changed server file
passes. Historical phi3.5 test logs below are left as-written (they record what was actually run then).

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-20) — Background indexing cadence scheduler (resume-on-relaunch + periodic tick)

The last unbuilt piece of the "ride on GNOME" loop. The bounded `gnome-sync` already leaves no-limit
overflow + any crash/quit-dropped files un-finalized so the *next* sync re-sees them (the durable
"continue" contract) — but nothing was firing those next syncs automatically. Now a server-side
scheduler does: it **resumes pending/overflow work for every synced folder on relaunch** and runs a
**light periodic delta tick** to pick up new/changed/deleted files going forward.

**Refactor first (no behaviour change):** extracted the whole durable PLAN/EXECUTE/finalize-on-confirm
orchestration out of the `gnome-sync` endpoint into **`GnomeBridge.runSync({slug,folder,exclude,limit,
dryRun,reconcile,userId,fromScheduler})`** → returns `{status, body}` (the HTTP-style code the endpoint
relays verbatim). The endpoint (`endpoints/workspaces.js`) is now a ~15-line wrapper; the scheduler
shares the **same** code path, so the subtle no-over-claim/durable logic can't drift between the two.
Endpoint contract unchanged (400/503/200-dryRun/202-execute).

**Scheduler (`server/utils/GnomeBridge/cadence.js`)**, wired into both `bootHTTP`/`bootSSL` listen
callbacks (`utils/boot/index.js`). THE #1 RULE governs every line:
- **Serial, machine-wide.** Never dispatches a folder's embed while ANY worker is still embedding
  (`Embed.hasRunningWorker()`) — one folder at a time, no piling on across workspaces.
- **Respects the global STOP.** New `ingestPaused` latch in `EmbeddingWorkerManager` — `stopAll()`
  sets it; the scheduler skips entirely while it's set. The kill switch *stays* killed: the flag clears
  only on an explicit user-driven (non-dryRun, non-scheduler) `runSync`, or a fresh app launch
  (in-memory). The scheduler's own runs pass `fromScheduler:true` and never clear it.
- **Never pokes the OS indexer silently.** Runs `reconcile:false`, so on a box where LocalSearch is
  dormant it just no-ops on the 503 and retries next tick — it never restarts a system service behind
  the user's back (deliberate, per [[k-base-ingest-safety]]).
- **Bounded.** Relies on `runSync`'s own per-call `GNOME_SYNC_CAP` + the embedder's per-doc cool-down.
- **Cadence:** a resume pass ~8 s after boot, then `setInterval` every `GNOME_CADENCE_MS` (default
  15 min). When a tick leaves work behind (overflow to drain, or a worker still busy) it schedules one
  short follow-up (`GNOME_CADENCE_FOLLOWUP_MS`, default 45 s) so resume/large-batch drains progress
  promptly instead of waiting a whole period between bounded chunks. Single-flight (`ticking` guard);
  all timers `unref()`'d so they never hold the process open. Off switch: `GNOME_CADENCE_DISABLED=1`.

**Verified (2026-06-20):** `node --check` on all 5 changed server files. Two isolated logic harnesses
(stub the two deps via the require cache): the scheduler's **10** guard/flow cases pass — paused →
zero dispatch; worker-running → serial skip + "work remains"; dispatch on folder A stops before
folder B; scheduler opts (`fromScheduler:true`/`reconcile:false`/`dryRun:false`) + saved `exclude`
carried; 503 → no-op; all-caught-up → no follow-up; re-entrant tick single-flights; empty state →
no-op. Plus **8** `EmbeddingWorkerManager`/`GnomeBridge` cases: pause flag latch/clear, `stopAll()`
latches the pause, `runSync`/`listSyncedSlugs` exported.

**✅ VERIFIED LIVE on this GNOME box (2026-06-20)** — against the real engine (TinySPARQL daemon up,
native ONNX embedder, real `BackgroundService` worker), throwaway `cadence-test` workspace, fully torn
down after. (A) **Boot wiring:** the real server logs `[gnome-cadence] started — resume in …s, tick
every 15m` and exits clean — no boot crash, empty-state resume tick no-ops. (B) **Drain, 11/11:**
`/home/user/Downloads` had 11 OS-indexed files; with `GNOME_SYNC_CAP=3` an initial user sync embedded 3
(state finalized 3 confirmed), then successive `cadence.tick()`s **drained 3 at a time — tracked
3→6→9→11** (57 vectors written to LanceDB), and the caught-up tick reported no work. (C) **STOP stays
stopped:** `stopAll()` latched the pause → the next tick no-op'd; a `dryRun` did NOT clear it; an
explicit (non-scheduler) user sync DID clear it. Teardown dropped the throwaway lance table + 57
vectors + 11 doc pins + workspace + doc folder + state file; the real `amadocs-library`/`teaching`/
`my-documents` workspaces were untouched. Not yet exercised through the **packaged Electron** app, but
the engine-side cadence path is now proven end to end on real GNOME.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-19) — Three UI skins (pure CSS theming, no structural change)

Added two more visual "feels" alongside the existing dark TUI look, all via the existing
`[data-theme]` + CSS-variable mechanism. **No structural/markup/feature changes** — same tree, tabs,
preview and REPL in every skin; the difference is colour + typeface + corner-rounding only.

- **Three skins**, cycled by the top-bar button (`toggleTheme()` → `THEMES` list / `applyTheme()`;
  default honours OS `prefers-color-scheme`):
  - `dark` → **"Terminal"** — dark · monospace · sharp. Byte-for-byte the prior look (its vars equal
    the old hardcoded values), so nothing regressed.
  - `slate` → **"Slate"** — new dim-slate palette · sans · blue accent · medium rounding. The
    "halfway between TUI and desktop" feel (blue accent nods to the search-first reference mock).
  - `light` → **"Desktop"** — the existing light theme, now genuinely sans + generous rounding
    (Finder/Obsidian feel).
- **Made the *feel* themeable, not just colour:** promoted typeface and corner-rounding to vars —
  `--font-ui` (mono vs sans) and `--radius` / `--radius-sm` / `--radius-xs`. `body` + the context-menu
  `font-family` now read `--font-ui`; the ~14 *chrome* `border-radius` values were swapped to the
  radius vars. The simulated document-page/image radii (2px / 0.14rem) were left fixed on purpose —
  a rendered doc shouldn't reflow because you reskinned the window chrome.
- Loaded **IBM Plex Sans** in the font `<link>` (also fixes a pre-existing fallback: the page-preview
  CSS already referenced Plex Sans but it was never loaded).
- Source of truth `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`, then `cp`'d to `amadocs-desktop/ui/index.html`
  (verified `diff -q` identical; the inter-copy diff was 100% these skin edits — zero functional drift).

**Gotcha (Electron launch on this box):** `yarn start` aborts with a `chrome-sandbox` SUID error
(*"…must be owned by root and have mode 4755"*). Proper fix needs one sudo:
`sudo chown root … && sudo chmod 4755 …/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox`. Dev workaround
used this session: `node_modules/.bin/electron . --no-sandbox`. Electron reuses a running dev stack
if `:3001` already answers (`main.js:197`), so launching it alongside `start-stack.sh` is fine.

## ✅ DONE (2026-06-19) — Phase 2 wiring (port prototype → real UI) — ALL STAGES A–D COMPLETE

Built the Phase 2 "semantic file manager" UI per `AMAdocs-SPEC.md`, staged in 4 stages (A–D).
Source of truth = `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`, `cp`'d to `amadocs-desktop/ui/index.html`.
Phase 1 UI backed up at `index.phase1.html` in both locations.

**✅ Stage A done (2026-06-19) — shell + plumbing port.** Replaced the Phase 1 chat UI with the
Phase 2 three-panel shell (file tree / content area / AI REPL) ported verbatim from
`tooling/amadocs-phase2-prototype.html` (dark+light themes, rem scaling, folder list/grid,
preview tabs+metastrip+docarea, right-click context menu). Carried the Phase 1 **engine plumbing**
into the new file as DOM-free / container-parameterized functions ready for stages B–D:
- config/auth: `API`, `API_TOKEN` fetch shim, `apiUrl()`; **`WS_SLUG="amadocs-library"`** (one
  global workspace — folder scope = `sourcePath` filter, NOT separate tables), per-launch `SESSION_ID`.
- `ensureLibraryWorkspace()` (creates the lib ws + forces `chatMode:"query"`; toggles the `#conn`
  banner), `fetchDocuments()`.
- citation→page loop: `getDocView`/`matchPage`/`resolveCitations`/`findPassageRegion`/
  `locatePassagePage` + `CITES`; `capAnswer`/`stripScaffolding`.
- `streamChat()` (DOM-free SSE helper — REPL renders its own frames in Stage D), `isModelMissingError`.
- `gnomeSync()` / `stopAllIngest()` thin helpers; `summarizeDoc`/`deepSearchDoc`.
- preview renderers parameterized to a container: `renderOriginalInto` → `renderPdfInto`
  (lazy per-page canvas + textLayer highlight), `renderImageInto` (+caption/OCR), `renderDocxInto`,
  `renderXlsxInto`, `renderTextInto`.

Static demo data still shows (replaced by live data in stages B–D). Checkpoint eyeballed live
(served on :8080, no engine): three-panel layout matches the prototype; folder↔preview switch +
REPL folder/file scope flip work; right-click menu opens with image-aware "analyse with AI"
primary; **zero JS console errors**; `node --check` on the inline script passes; `#conn` banner
shows correctly when the engine is down.

**✅ Stage B done (2026-06-19) — live file tree (steps 4 / file tree wiring).** Replaced the
static demo `#tree` + folder markup with the **real filesystem**, read through the Electron
preload bridge (`window.amadocs.readDir` / `.homePath`). New code lives in a self-contained
"STAGE B — LIVE FILE TREE" block in the inline script (just above the BOOT IIFE), plus a
generalized `showFile()`/`showFolder()` (now state-driven via a `view` object, demo id-juggling
removed) and an image-aware tweak to `openCtx` (`isImageName` fallback). What it does:
- **Tree:** root = `await homePath()`, auto-expanded. Folders lazy-load children on first expand
  (`readDir` → `makeTreeNode` rows, dirs-first, dotfiles hidden, unreadable/empty → ghost note).
  Chevron toggles ▸/▾; per-row `○` is a neutral AI-state placeholder (Stage C fills ●/○).
- **Selection = scope:** left-click folder → folder view (list + grid rendered from `readDir`,
  real type badges/size/mtime, neutral AI chips) + REPL scope label + intro. Left-click file →
  preview view (tab + metastrip type/size/modified/indexed-unknown + "indexed later" docarea note).
- **Helpers:** `joinPath`/`baseName`/`parentPath`/`extOf`/`badgeFor`/`isImageName`/`fmtBytes`/
  `fmtDate` (POSIX; Linux/GNOME target). AI state, live preview, indexing and chat stay neutral —
  Stages C/D. Without the bridge (browser dev stack) the whole block no-ops and the static
  prototype is left in place.

**Stage B verification (2026-06-19):** inline JS parses (vm.Script over both no-`src` scripts, 0
fail); helper unit-tests pass in node (path/badge/bytes/date edge cases incl. dotfile-has-no-ext,
uppercase ext, unknown→b-txt, 1.5 KB / 1.4 MB rounding). Faithful live checkpoint via a throwaway
`_btest.html` (real page + a mocked `window.amadocs` over a fake FS, served on :8182, driven in
Chrome): home auto-expands, `.cache` dotfile hidden; expanding Documents/→Reports/ lazy-loads and
nests correctly (dirs-first); folder header + list rows + REPL scope track the selection; file
click → preview (tab "Annual-Review-2025.pdf", metastrip "PDF · 1.4 MB · 2025-12-08 · indexed
unknown", back "‹ Reports/", scope "— Annual-Review-2025.pdf", 2 demo tabs hidden, single tree
`.sel`); right-click image → "analyse with AI" primary, right-click PDF → "re-analyse with AI"
(not primary); back button returns to the folder. **Zero console errors** on the live path AND on
the no-bridge fallback (static prototype intact, 17-row demo tree + MOUNTS untouched). `_btest.html`
+ the :8182 server were removed after. Synced to `amadocs-desktop/ui/`. NEXT = Stage C (steps 5–6:
AI-state chips via `fetchDocuments × sourcePath`, folder indexing via `gnomeSync`).

**✅ Stage C done (2026-06-19) — live AI state + folder indexing (steps 5–6).** Added a
self-contained "STAGE C — LIVE AI STATE" block (just before BOOT) that gives every rendered
filesystem entry its real AI status, and wired the folder "⟳ index" action. What it does:
- **Doc index:** `loadDocIndex()` calls the carried `fetchDocuments()` (`GET /workspace/amadocs-library`
  → `ws.documents`), parses each doc's `metadata` JSON, and keys a module-level `Map`
  (`docIndex`) by on-disk **`sourcePath`** → `{mode, aiSummary, docpath, sourceMime}`. Docs with no
  `sourcePath` are skipped (e.g. legacy uploads). Also feeds `docpathByName` (title→docpath) so the
  carried citation loop resolves. Pulled once in BOOT **before** `initFileTree()` so the first paint
  already has state; refilled (`.clear()` first) on every refresh.
- **`aiStateFor(path,name)`** — the single decision point (pure, reads `docIndex`). Returns
  `{indexed, chipCls, chipLabel, dotOn, summary}` for the four states: indexed+`deep`→`● ✓ deep`,
  indexed+`summary` (`amadocsSearchMode`)→`● ✓ catalog`, unindexed image (`isImageName`)→`○ ⚡ analyse`,
  unindexed non-image→`○ ○ pending`. Drives the **tree dot** (`makeTreeNode`: `don`/`doff`), the
  **folder list/grid** chips + dots + the grid summary text (real `aiSummary` when present; the
  amber "Right-click → Analyse" hint for images; pending name uses the `.pending` muted style), the
  **folder header** count (`N files · …  · M indexed`) + sort-strip (`● M indexed · ○ K pending`),
  the **tree counter** (`idx <docIndex.size>`), and the **preview** metastrip (`indexed ● deep`/
  `needs analysis`/`pending`) + the right-panel SUMMARY card (real `aiSummary` or a neutral note).
- **`onSyncFolder()`** (the header `#btnSync` "⟳ index") — THE #1 RULE-safe: a `dryRun` gnome-sync
  previews the plan (`queued`/`indexed`/`remaining`); `queued===0` toasts "already indexed"/"nothing
  catalogued" and just refreshes. Otherwise a real run kicks off the bounded async embed (202), then
  `refreshAiState()` re-pulls `docIndex` and repaints the open folder + every rendered tree dot +
  the counter, with a 4 s follow-up refresh to catch fast completions (live SSE progress is Stage D).
  No-ops (toast) without the desktop bridge.

**Stage C verification (2026-06-19):** both inline scripts parse (vm.Script, 0 fail); node unit-tests
over the **extracted real** `loadDocIndex`/`aiStateFor` bodies pass (sourcePath-keyed mapping skips
no-path docs, deep/summary modes, image vs non-image fallbacks, citation-registry title→filename
fallback, `.clear()` on refill). Faithful live checkpoint via a throwaway `_stageC_check.html` (real
page + mocked `window.amadocs` fake-FS + a canned-engine `fetch` stub whose real gnome-sync flips a
pending file to indexed), served on :8183, driven in Chrome: Home shows `0 indexed · 2 pending` +
`IDX 3`; Documents/ renders all four chips correctly (`a.pdf ✓ deep`, `b.md ✓ catalog`,
`big.pdf ✓ deep`, `draft.txt ○ pending`, `diagram.png ⚡ analyse`) with matching tree dots and
`5 files · 1 folder · 3 indexed`; clicking **⟳ index** toasts "Indexing 1 file(s)…" and `draft.txt`
flips `○ pending → ● ✓ deep` (dot + chip), header → `4 indexed`, sort-strip → `4 indexed · 1 pending`,
counter → `IDX 4`, `diagram.png` stays `⚡ analyse` (image excluded from bulk index); file click →
preview metastrip `indexed ● deep` + the real `aiSummary` in the SUMMARY card. **Zero console errors**
(checked after reload). `_stageC_check.html` + the :8183 server removed after; synced to
`amadocs-desktop/ui/`.

**✅ Stage D done (2026-06-19) — REPL chat + context-menu actions (steps 7–8).** Wired the live
REPL chat and all context-menu actions. Three engine files changed + UI wired:

**Engine (3 files):**
- `server/utils/vectorDbProviders/lance/index.js` — added `scopePath` param to
  `performSimilaritySearch`, `similarityResponse`, `rerankedSimilarityResponse`. If set, adds
  `.where(starts_with(sourcePath, '<path>'))` as a pre-filter on the LanceDB vector search.
  Probed: unquoted identifier resolves case-insensitively in DataFusion (lancedb 0.15.0);
  quoted double-quotes resolve the column but return 0 rows — must stay unquoted. `.where()` is
  a pre-filter by default (confirmed: `postfilter(true)` is the explicit post-filter API). Both
  folder prefix (`/path/folder/`) and exact file path (`/path/file.pdf`) work via `starts_with`.
- `server/utils/chats/stream.js` — added `scopePath` to `streamChatWithWorkspace` signature,
  threads it to `performSimilaritySearch`.
- `server/endpoints/chat.js` — extracts `scopePath` from POST body, passes to
  `streamChatWithWorkspace`.

**UI (`tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`, synced to `amadocs-desktop/ui/`):**
- `streamChat()` — accepts `scopePath` option, includes in POST body if set.
- `openCtx(e, entryPath)` — upgraded from `filename`-only to full path. Stores in module-level
  `ctxEntryPath`. Live call sites (tree nodes via `full`, list/grid rows via `el.dataset.path`)
  pass the full path; static demo rows pass just the name and fall back gracefully.
- `selectFolder()` — intro text now includes a `<div id="replFolderConv">` anchor for queries.
- `showFilePreview()` — `#docarea` now calls `renderOriginalInto()` for indexed files (real
  preview); `#replFile` renders summary card + `<div id="replFileConv">` for conversation.
- New **STAGE D** block:
  - `runRepl()` — resolves scope from `view.filePath`/`view.folderPath`, calls `streamChat`

## 🧭 CURRENT PHASE (2026-06-16) — Semantic search by *riding on* GNOME (TinySPARQL/LocalSearch)

**The bet:** AMAdocs' real value = a semantic/LLM layer on top of the full-text + metadata
extraction the OS desktop indexer (**GNOME LocalSearch**, storing into **TinySPARQL**, the
renamed Tracker3) already does for free. Whole-folder semantic search **from AMAdocs**, without
re-implementing crawl/extract. Test corpus = **`/mnt/space/teaching_docs`**. Architecture chosen
(2026-06-16): **"Ride on TinySPARQL (hybrid)"** — read extracted text from the OS index for the
digital-text majority; use AMAdocs' own parser/OCR/vision only for the blind spots.

**Machine reality (this Arch + ML4W/Hyprland box):** `tinysparql` + `localsearch` **3.11.1**
installed but were **DORMANT** — never run, no index. The user unit `localsearch-3.service` has
`ConditionEnvironment=XDG_SESSION_CLASS=user`, which is unset in the systemd `--user` manager (no
`gnome-session`), so it never auto-starts. **Woke it manually:**
```bash
systemctl --user set-environment XDG_SESSION_CLASS=user
systemctl --user start localsearch-3.service
```
⚠️ **Thesis caveat:** outside a real GNOME Shell session the OS index does **nothing** — AMAdocs
must *enable & own* LocalSearch, not just read a populated store. On a real GNOME box it'd already
be warm.

**Scoped the index to the test folder (saved the old value to restore):**
```bash
# old value was ['$HOME']  → saved in /tmp/localsearch-old-recursive.txt
gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files index-recursive-directories "['/mnt/space/teaching_docs']"
gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files index-single-directories "@as []"
```

**Eval results (teaching_docs: 1.1G, 805 extractable docs — 424 pdf, 101 docx, 57 xlsx, 191 md, 6 pptx, 26 jpeg):**
- Crawled **in seconds** (idle-aware, no strain). **648 docs got extracted full text (~19.8M
  chars)**: 424 pdf + 191 md + 17 txt + 16 html. PDF extraction excellent (whole novels ~1M chars
  each; forms; resource packs). Rich metadata too (pageCount/wordCount/created/author/generator).
  Instant FTS5 keyword search (this *is* GNOME Files search). PDF text-layer coverage ~97%
  (29/30 sampled have a digital text layer).
- **3 blind spots = where AMAdocs earns its place:**
  1. ⚠️ **Office docs silently dropped.** **WPS Office** installed user mime defs in
     `~/.local/share/mime/` (`application/wps-office.docx`, …) that win **content-sniffing**;
     LocalSearch's OOXML extractor rule (`/usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/11-msoffice-xml.rule`)
     only matches the *standard* OOXML mimes → **all 164 docx/xlsx/pptx (20% of corpus) skipped,
     no error**. The extractor MODULE works fine — `localsearch extract <file>` on a docx yields
     perfect text+metadata; only the daemon's content-type *routing* fails. (Lesson: riding on the
     OS index inherits the OS's silent blind spots.)
  2. **No OCR / vision** — PDF extractor is poppler text-layer only; scanned PDFs (~3%) and the 26
     jpegs come back empty. (AMAdocs' existing OCR + moondream captioning fills this.)
  3. **Lexical only** — FTS is keyword-OR (e.g. `"narrative writing feedback"` → 0 as a phrase, 44
     by word-OR); no concept→wording bridge. That semantic layer is AMAdocs' job.

**Division of labor (now evidence-based):** GNOME owns crawl/monitor/extract of digital text +
metadata (the "don't melt the laptop" problem, already solved by the OS — cf. the parked AI Finder,
"AI Finder (#3)" below). AMAdocs owns embeddings + semantic retrieval + the LLM-answer/citation
loop + backstop extraction for the 3 blind spots.

**Querying TinySPARQL:** `tinysparql query --dbus-service=org.freedesktop.LocalSearch3 -q '<SPARQL>'`.
GOTCHAS: (a) `nie:url` is on the **file** node, `nie:plainTextContent`+`nie:mimeType` on the linked
**content** node — join via `?ie nie:isStoredAs ?do . ?do nie:url ?u`. (b) The CLI has **no JSON
output**, and a standalone `tinysparql endpoint` over the on-disk `~/.cache/tracker3/files/meta.db`
sees an **empty view** (the live daemon holds the WAL) — so query the live daemon over **D-Bus**.

**✅ BUILT — the bridge: `tooling/tinysparql-bridge.js`** (run under Node 22). Queries the live
LocalSearch daemon over D-Bus (file-based queries via `-f` to dodge shell escaping; CONCAT with a
U+001F field delimiter + a newline sentinel so each result row stays one physical line), pulls
`nie:plainTextContent` + metadata for every file under a folder prefix, and writes
**AnythingLLM-shaped document JSONs** (`id/url/title/docAuthor/pageContent/wordCount/…` — the same
shape `collector/.../asPDF` emits) into `server/storage/documents/tinysparql-teaching/`, plus an
embed manifest `tooling/tinysparql-adds.json`. Those paths feed the normal embed path
`POST /workspace/:slug/update-embeddings {adds:[...]}` (native ONNX embedder, **no Ollama needed**).
So AMAdocs adds embeddings on top of the OS-extracted text **without re-parsing**. Verified: writes
correct JSON with real full text + metadata (e.g. a 9,343-char markdown doc). The blind-spot files
have no `plainTextContent` in the index, so they're naturally absent — handled separately by
AMAdocs' own pipeline.
- ⚠️ **Consequence:** TinySPARQL text is **flat — no per-page ranges**. So bridged docs lose the
  citation chip's **page-number label** (`matchPage` has no `pages` to map). The **passage
  highlight** still works (it text-matches against the rendered PDF). Reconstruct `pages` via
  poppler later if the label matters.
- **✅ FIXED (2026-06-16) — bridged docs are now first-class for the viewer + citation loop.**
  Bridged docs never go through the collector's originals-retention path, so they have **no retained
  original** under `storage/originals/<docId>.<ext>` → `doc-original` 404'd → the "Text and images"
  render and the citation PDF-jump were broken for them. Fix: `doc-original` (`endpoints/workspaces.js`)
  now falls back to streaming the user's **real file in place via `data.sourcePath`** when the doc is a
  bridged one (`amadocsSource === "tinysparql"`) and no retained copy exists (gated on
  `fs.statSync(sourcePath).isFile()`; MIME-mapped; retained-original path and the normal 404 both
  unchanged — regression-tested on a normal doc). Verified: `doc-original` for a bridged PDF now
  returns the real 8-page `application/pdf`; `doc-view` returns the full text with `pages:null`
  (graceful — no page label, passage-highlight still works). Net: the only thing bridged docs still
  lack vs. dropped-in docs is the page-NUMBER chip label (flat text). The literal in-browser
  highlight render stays the standing human-eyeball item (matcher already validated against real PDF.js).

**Staying fresh = INCREMENTAL, never re-embed the whole corpus.** GNOME hands us the diff:
- **It keeps its own store live for free** — config has `enable-monitors true`; LocalSearch uses
  **inotify** to update TinySPARQL in near-real-time on add/change/delete. (This is the hard
  "filesystem watching" problem that got the AI Finder parked — inherited solved.)
- **Per-file `nfo:fileLastModified`** (verified populated on all 2,995 files) → delta query:
  `SELECT ?url WHERE { ?do nfo:fileLastModified ?m . FILTER(?m > "<last-sync>"^^xsd:dateTime) }`
  (tested working). Optional push alternative: **`TrackerNotifier`** D-Bus events
  (created/updated/deleted) for event-driven sync instead of polling — v2 nicety, not needed for v1.
- **AMAdocs already has the per-file ops:** changed/new → re-embed just that file (the
  `doc-deep-search` delete-vectors-by-docId → re-add path); deleted/moved → `update-embeddings
  {deletes}`. Cost scales with *changes*, not corpus size.
- **Cadence:** delta-sync on app launch + a light periodic tick; plus an occasional cheap
  **path-set reconcile** (diff GNOME's file list vs. ours — no re-embed — to catch missed
  deletes/renames). All through the safe serial/cool-down queue + global STOP ([[k-base-ingest-safety]]).
- ⚠️ **Caveat (recurring):** GNOME's store only stays live while `localsearch` runs — dormant by
  default on this non-GNOME box. So the refresh flow is **ensure the indexer has run (start it, let
  its idle-aware crawl catch up) → read the delta**. AMAdocs owns keeping it alive, not just reading.

**✅ BUILT + VERIFIED E2E (2026-06-16) — incremental delta-sync: `tooling/tinysparql-sync.js`**
(shares `tooling/lib/tinysparql-lib.js` with the bridge — the bridge was refactored to a thin wrapper
over that lib so both full-pull and delta use one doc-builder; identical Arrow-safe schema). Keeps a
workspace's embeddings in step with the OS index **without re-embedding the corpus**.
- **State:** `tooling/tinysparql-sync-state.<slug>.json` maps `sourceUrl → {docpath, mtime}`. **First
  run BOOTSTRAPS** — adopts whatever's already embedded (maps the live workspace docs' `metadata.url`
  → `docpath`) and records *every* current indexed file's mtime as a dormant baseline, so the 530
  not-yet-embedded files aren't later mistaken for "new." No embedding on bootstrap.
- **Diff → one `update-embeddings {adds,deletes}` POST:** `NEW` (indexed, not in state) → embed;
  `CHANGED` (managed file, `nfo:fileLastModified` advanced) → **delete old docpath + add fresh** (new
  random docpath ⇒ new vector-cache key, so no stale-cache reuse — sidesteps the docpath-keyed cache
  gotcha without needing `skipCache`); `DELETED` (managed file gone from index) → delete. Knobs:
  `SYNC_NEW=0` (track new files but don't embed them), `DRY_RUN=1` (print plan only).
- **Verified live, full NEW→CHANGED→DELETED cycle** on a throwaway `_sync_test.md` with made-up facts
  the model can't know: NEW → embedded (100→101 docs), retrieval returned the planted facts citing it
  @0.985; CHANGED (rewrote the facts) → re-embed swapped vectors in place, retrieval returned the
  **new** facts with zero trace of the old; DELETED → vectors removed (back to 100), retrieval → "no
  relevant information," 0 sources. **Crucially the dry-run showed exactly 1 changed, not 630** — the
  reconcile re-crawl preserves each file's real filesystem mtime, so only the genuinely-changed file
  re-embeds. Cost scales with *changes*, not corpus size, as designed.
- 🔎 **Two findings worth keeping:** (1) `nfo:fileLastModified` is stored with **two identical values
  per file**, which doubled every `queryFileList` row → fixed with `GROUP BY ?u` + `MAX(?m)`.
  (2) ⚠️ **inotify live-monitoring did NOT fire on this non-GNOME box** despite `enable-monitors=true`
  — a new/changed/deleted file was invisible to the daemon until **`systemctl --user restart
  localsearch-3.service`** forced a reconcile crawl. So on a non-GNOME desktop the freshness flow must
  **actively poke/restart the indexer** (or run its own watcher) before reading the delta — relying on
  GNOME's monitors only works inside a real GNOME session. (On a real GNOME box the restart step is
  unnecessary; the `TrackerNotifier` D-Bus push path is the v2 nicety to avoid polling there.) The
  restart is heavier than ideal but correct, and the re-crawl is idle-aware. Wiring this into the safe
  serial queue + a launch/periodic cadence ([[k-base-ingest-safety]]) is the remaining build.

**✅ PRODUCTIONIZED into the engine (2026-06-16) — `POST /workspace/:slug/gnome-sync`.** The bridge +
sync moved off the CLI tooling into the server so the app (UI/Electron) can drive "index a GNOME folder
into a workspace and keep it fresh" directly. **`server/utils/GnomeBridge/index.js`** is the ported
bridge (query LocalSearch over D-Bus → AnythingLLM-shaped doc JSONs into `storage/documents/gnome-<slug>/`;
state in `storage/gnome-sync/<slug>.json`; dev/prod storage-path aware). The endpoint
(`endpoints/workspaces.js`, body `{folder, exclude?="/novels/", limit?=0, dryRun?=false}`): **first call
= full index** (embeds every file LocalSearch has text for, up to `limit`; the rest recorded as a dormant
baseline); **later calls = delta-sync** (re-embed only new/changed via `nfo:fileLastModified`, drop
deleted) — same `computeDelta` as the CLI. Embeds via the engine's own `embedFiles` (native worker) /
`Document.addDocuments`; deletes via `Document.removeDocuments` (mirrors `update-embeddings`).
`Gnome.available()` guards with a clean **503** when the indexer isn't running. **Verified live:** dryRun
is read-only (writes 0 JSONs); a `limit:30` index embedded **30 distinct real docs** (no dupes), a
semantic query returned a grounded IGCSE-syllabus answer, and an immediate follow-up sync was idempotent
(`added:0, deleted:0`).
- ⚠️ **BUG found + fixed mid-build (worth remembering):** the **U+001F field-separator char was lost
  when the util file was written** (the invisible control byte didn't survive the editor write → `US`
  became `""`), so `row.split("")` exploded every result row into single characters (doc `url:"f"`,
  `mtime:"i"` — 30 copies of one garbage file). Fix: declare the separators with **explicit escape
  codes in source** (`US = ""`, `NL = "␛"`), not literal invisible chars. Lesson: never rely
  on literal control characters surviving file-write tooling — use `\uXXXX`.

**✅ DONE (2026-06-16) — the "ride on GNOME" loop is PROVEN E2E.** Booted the dev stack (Node 22),
created a `teaching` workspace (query mode + reranker on), bridged a **100-doc real-teaching slice**
(novels excluded — see bridge change below), embedded all 100 via `update-embeddings`, and ran real
semantic queries. **The whole thesis works:** GNOME LocalSearch-extracted PDF/HTML/md text → bridge →
native-ONNX embed → semantic retrieval → grounded phi3.5 answer **with source attribution tagged
`[tinysparql]`**. E.g. *"What reading/writing skills does IGCSE First Language English assess?"* →
accurate grounded answer citing the syllabus PDF (score 0.998); a concept→wording query (*"how are
students taught to analyse a writer's use of language for effect?"*) correctly bridged to the syllabus'
R1/R2/R4 objectives + the specimen mark scheme — the exact semantic lift FTS can't do. Small md notes
retrieve too (a schedule query pulled `2026-06-08 Full School Rehearsal.md`). Caveats observed, all
already-known: phi3.5 leaks `Context N` scaffolding + embellishes in the **raw** stream (the UI's
`stripScaffolding()`/`capAnswer()` handle both — the `ask-src.js` harness bypasses them); and bridged
docs are flat text so sources attribute by **title, no page-label** (passage-highlight still works via
text-match — by design, see the flat-text caveat above).

- **⚠️ BUG FOUND + FIXED — the bridge must emit a consistent Arrow schema (no `undefined` fields).**
  First embed run: only **14/100** docs landed; 86 (all the tiny md notes) failed with
  `LanceError(Arrow): Need at least 4 bytes in buffers[0] in array of type Utf8, but got 0`. Root
  cause (reproduced directly against the live LanceDB table): the **first** embedded doc fixes the
  collection's Arrow schema; the first alphabetical doc was a PDF carrying `pageCount` (Float64), so
  the schema included that column. The bridge emitted `pageCount: undefined` for non-paged docs
  (markdown) → JSON.stringify **drops** the key → those single-chunk batches `.add()` a row *missing*
  a schema column, and LanceDB-node builds a malformed 0-byte Utf8 buffer for it → the whole insert
  throws. **Fix:** bridge now emits `pageCount: 0` (always a number, never undefined) so every doc's
  key set is identical. Verified: re-embed of the same 100 → **100/100, zero failures.** (General
  lesson for any future custom doc-JSON producer: keep the field set identical across all docs — an
  omitted key on a single-chunk doc is enough to break LanceDB's `.add()`.)
- **Bridge change (`tooling/tinysparql-bridge.js`):** added `env EXCLUDE` (default `/novels/`) +
  `ORDER BY ?u` so a `LIMIT` slice is deterministic and skips the public-domain corpus-filler books
  (648→630 real teaching docs; the slice is IGCSE syllabi/past-papers/mark-schemes + schedule notes).

**NEXT:** (1) ⚠️ **EYEBALLED LIVE (2026-06-17) — render works, but found a real bridged-doc highlight bug
(see "⚠️ FINDING" below).** The chip resolves, clicking opens the **real PDF** (via the `doc-original`→
`sourcePath` fallback), PDF.js renders pixel-accurately, scrolls, and paints a highlight — but for a
bridged doc the highlight **latched onto recurring page boilerplate instead of the cited passage** when
that passage was past page 5 (a silent mis-highlight, not just the missing page-label). **✅ FIXED same
day** (scan-all-pages + cluster-hardened matcher — see "⚠️ FINDING" → "✅ FIXED" below); re-verified live,
highlight now lands on the real passage. Only the `p.N` chip label remains (poppler follow-up).
(2) ✅ **DONE — `gnome-sync` wired into the safe
serial queue** (cool-down + hard STOP + durable finalize-on-confirm + bounded + `ensureIndexer` behind
a `reconcile` flag; see "✅ BUILT … wire `gnome-sync` into the safe ingest queue" below). Remaining
under #2 = the launch/periodic cadence scheduler (the kill/STOP mid-batch live-stack E2E is CLOSED). (3) ✅
**DONE + EYEBALLED LIVE — the UI/Electron flow**: a sidebar "📂 Sync a folder" button → native folder picker
(`dialog.showOpenDialog`) → pick an existing/new collection → an upfront dryRun banner → live progress +
Continue + a STOP button, all driven live in the running app (see "✅ BUILT + EYEBALLED LIVE (2026-06-17) —
gnome-sync UI/Electron flow" below). Remaining overall = the **cadence scheduler** + the cosmetic `p.N`
bridged-doc label. See [[tinysparql-integration]] + [[k-base-ingest-safety]] in product memory.

### ⚠️ FINDING (2026-06-17) — bridged-doc citation highlight mis-targets boilerplate past page 5

**The live eyeball of NEXT #1 PASSED on render but FAILED on highlight precision** — exactly the class
of thing only an eyeball catches. Reproduced on the running Electron app (dev stack reused) against the
`teaching` workspace's 100-doc bridged slice. Harness: `tooling/eyeball-cite.js` (raw DevTools/CDP —
no puppeteer; `Runtime.evaluate` to drive + `Page.captureScreenshot`; screenshots in
`tooling/logs/cite-{1,2,3}-*.png`). Query: *"What reading and writing assessment objectives does the
IGCSE First Language English syllabus assess?"* → grounded R1–R5/W1–W4 answer citing the bridged
syllabus PDF @1.000.

**What works (verified live):**
- Chip resolves and is clickable; it carries **no `· p.N` label** (graceful — bridged docs are flat
  text, `doc-view` returns `pages:null`, `matchPage`→null). As designed.
- Clicking → `doc-original` streams the **real on-disk PDF** via the `data.sourcePath` fallback
  (bridged docs have no retained original) → PDF.js renders the page **pixel-accurately** (the
  "Why study this syllabus?" page with the Cambridge-learner diagram), scrolls, and paints a yellow
  text-layer highlight. The whole bridged → embed → retrieve → cite → open-PDF loop is real.

**The bug (root-caused in `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` `renderPdf`, line ~864–875):**
- `needle = normWS(stripChunkHeader(targetText))` (header-strip is fine), but `tp = targetPage` is
  **null** for bridged docs (no page ranges). With `tp` null the highlight search window defaults to
  `startP=1, endP=min(numPages, startP+4)` → **only pages 1–5 are ever searched.**
- The cited R1–R5 passage lives deep in the syllabus (~p.15), **outside** the 1–5 window. So the only
  fragment of the needle that matches within pages 1–5 is the **recurring footer**
  `"Cambridge IGCSE First Language English 0500 syllabus for 2027, 2028 and 2029."` (on every page) →
  `findPassageRegion` highlights that **boilerplate on an early page** instead of the real passage.
  Confirmed: captured `hlText` was exactly that footer line, on an early page.
- Net: for any bridged-doc citation whose passage is past page 5, the highlight is not just absent but
  **actively misleading** (points at page furniture). Dropped-in docs are unaffected — they carry
  `pages` ranges, so `tp` anchors the window on the real passage and the 5-page span covers it.

**Fix options (a design call):**
1. **Scan all pages when `tp` is null** (`startP=1, endP=numPages`, short-circuit on first *strong*
   hit). Simplest; correct; cost = render text layer for every page of big PDFs (mitigate: only build
   the text layer, skip the canvas raster until a hit; or cap at N pages with a "not found" fallback).
2. **Reconstruct `pages` for bridged docs via poppler** at bridge time (already flagged as a "later"
   task under the flat-text caveat above) — gives a real page anchor so the existing 5-page window
   works, and restores the `p.N` chip label for free. Heavier but fixes both the highlight and the
   label.
3. **Harden `findPassageRegion`** to reject short/recurring matches (require a longer contiguous span,
   or prefer the page with maximal needle coverage) so it can't latch onto a one-line footer. Belt for
   (1)/(2), not a standalone fix.

**✅ FIXED (2026-06-17) — chose (1) + (3); (2) left as the page-label follow-up.** UI-only, both copies
synced (`tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` is source of truth → `cp` to `amadocs-desktop/ui/`):
- **`renderPdf`** — when there's no page anchor (`targetPage` null), call the new **`locatePassagePage(pdf,
  needle)`** to find the right page by a **cheap text-only scan over ALL pages** (no canvas raster — just
  `page.getTextContent()`), then run the existing render+highlight on that page. Anchored (dropped-doc)
  citations are unchanged — they skip the scan.
- **`locatePassagePage`** picks the page with the **largest contiguous match cluster** and requires it to
  be `>=3` fragment hits, so a lone recurring header/footer (which scores ~1–2) can't win.
- **`findPassageRegion`** rewritten to return `{lo,hi,score,count}` and highlight the **largest contiguous
  cluster** of fragment hits rather than the union of all hits — so a far-away footer match can no longer
  balloon the highlighted region across the page. Its one caller (`renderPdfPageHighlight`) updated to the
  object shape.
- **Re-verified live (same CDP harness):** the syllabus citation now highlights **10 spans** of the real
  R1–R5/W1–W4 assessment-objectives passage on the correct deep page (`hlText` = *"This question tests the
  following reading assessment objectives (10 marks): R1 demonstrate understanding of explicit meanings R2
  …"*), vs. the single footer span before. Screenshot `tooling/logs/cite-3-viewer.png`. The bridged-doc
  citation loop is now trustworthy; the only remaining gap is the `p.N` chip label (fix option 2, poppler).

### ✅ BUG — FIXED (2026-06-19, root cause from 2026-06-17) — drag-drop uploads FAILED in a workspace that has bridged (gnome-sync) docs: incompatible LanceDB Arrow schemas

**Symptom (user-reported, reproduced live):** dropping normal files into the `teaching` workspace → the
files parse + summarise fine, then **vanish** ("it won't read anything" / "couldn't read that file"). No
parsing error — the failure is at the **embed/insert** step.

**Server log signature:**
```
[VectorDB::LanceDb] addDocumentToNamespace lance error: LanceError(Arrow): Invalid argument error:
Last offset 1083955200 of Utf8 is larger than values length 0   →   Failed to vectorize <file>.docx
```

**Root cause — two doc producers write two different Arrow schemas into the same table.** A LanceDB
table's column set is **fixed by the first row ever inserted**, and the `teaching` table was first
populated by **bridged tinysparql docs** (`GnomeBridge`), which carry four extra metadata columns the
normal collector upload path does NOT emit. Verified by dumping both schemas:

| `teaching.lance` (seeded by bridge) | `my-documents.lance` (normal uploads) |
|---|---|
| id, url, title, docAuthor, description, docSource, chunkSource, published, wordCount, **amadocsSource, sourceMime, sourcePath, pageCount**, token_count_estimate, text, vector | id, url, title, docAuthor, description, docSource, chunkSource, published, wordCount, token_count_estimate, text, vector |

A normal dropped doc has no `amadocsSource/sourceMime/sourcePath/pageCount`, so its row is **missing
schema columns** → LanceDB-node builds a malformed 0-byte Utf8 buffer (hence the absurd `Last offset …`
> `values length 0`) → the `.add()` throws → vectorize fails → the doc never lands → it "disappears."
This is the **same class** as the 2026-06-16 bridge bug ("keep the field set identical across all docs —
an omitted key on a single-chunk doc is enough to break LanceDB's `.add()`"), but the inverse direction:
there the bridge omitted a key; here the *upload path* omits the keys the bridge established.

**⚠️ Schema survives an empty table.** Clearing all docs (rows → 0) does **NOT** reset the column set —
the table keeps its schema, so drops keep failing until the table itself is dropped/recreated.

**One-time unblock done (2026-06-17):** `db.dropTable("teaching")` (it was 0 rows — nothing lost; the
workspace row in SQLite is untouched). The table auto-recreates with whichever producer writes first
next — so to stay healthy, **seed it with a normal upload** (or keep bridged + uploaded docs in
*separate* workspaces). Repro/inspect schema: `@lancedb/lancedb` → `connect("server/storage/lancedb")`
→ `openTable(slug).schema()`.

**⚠️ Correction to the schema table above (verified live 2026-06-19).** The producers actually
diverge on **five** columns, not four — the 2026-06-17 dump missed `aiSummary`. The normal collector
upload emits `aiSummary` (`collector/processSingleFile/index.js:61-66`) which the **bridge does not**;
the bridge emits `amadocsSource/sourceMime/sourcePath/pageCount` which the **upload does not**. (The
live `teaching.lance` is now *upload*-seeded — `…,token_count_estimate,aiSummary,text,vector`, 13
cols, no amadocs cols — re-created since the 2026-06-17 dropTable, so it's the inverse of what the
table above shows.) The bug bites in **both** seeding directions; reproduced both directly against
`@lancedb/lancedb`.

**✅ Durable fix DONE (2026-06-19) — the gnome schema dominates (full union).** Both producers now
emit an **identical** column set, normalized at the single choke point every embed passes through:
`LanceDb.addDocumentToNamespace` (`server/utils/vectorDbProviders/lance/index.js`). A module-level
`withAmadocsSchema(metadata)` helper forces the full 5-column union onto every doc —
`amadocsSource/sourceMime/sourcePath` → `""`, `pageCount` → `0`, `aiSummary` → `""` when absent — so a
workspace can freely mix bridged + dropped docs in either seeding order (both verified SUCCESS).
Applied in **both** the fresh-embed path and the vector-cache replay path. Safe against embedding
pollution: `TextSplitter.buildHeaderMeta` plucks only `title/published/chunkSource`, so none of the
five columns ever leak into chunk text.

⚠️ **Migration caveat (affects the live `teaching` table now):** LanceDB locks a table's schema at
its first row (and the schema survives an empty table). This fix gives every **newly created** table
the full union. Tables created **before** this fix keep their old set — e.g. the current `teaching`
(13 cols, 12 rows, no amadocs cols) will now reject the wider post-fix writes, so it must be
**dropped + re-indexed** (`db.dropTable("teaching")`, the same one-time unblock; the SQLite workspace
row is untouched, the 12 rows are re-embeddable) to adopt the new schema. On a fresh `storage/`
(gitignored, re-indexed from GNOME per the handover) this is a non-issue; Phase 2 also retires
drag-drop as a producer. See [[tinysparql-integration]].

### ✅ BUILT (2026-06-16) — `gnome-sync` wired into the safe ingest queue (NEXT item #2)

The safety wiring ([[k-base-ingest-safety]] — THE #1 RULE) is **coded + unit/logic-verified** (live
E2E on the dev stack is the remaining human-eyeball item — see "Verification" below). All five gaps
identified in the plan are now closed; built *on* the existing serial worker, not replacing it:

1. **Cool-down between docs** — `jobs/embedding-worker.js` now waits `cooldownMs` BETWEEN documents
   (never before the first / after the last, even across recursion via a module-level `processedAny`);
   value threaded from the parent. `utils/EmbeddingWorkerManager.js` reads it from **`EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS`**
   (default **750ms**; `.env.development` sets **0** for fast dev iteration).
2. **Hard STOP** — worker handles a `{type:"stop"}` message (clear queue, set a `stopping` flag the
   loop checks between items, emit `stopped`, `process.exit(0)`); manager adds **`stopWorkspace(slug)`**
   and **`stopAll()`** (send `stop` + `worker.kill("SIGTERM")`, clean up `runningWorkers`/history). The
   exit handler distinguishes a deliberate stop (emits a clean `stopped`) from a crash (the old
   "exited unexpectedly" all_complete).
3. **STOP endpoints** — `POST /workspace/:slug/embedding-stop` → `stopWorkspace`; `POST /system/stop-all`
   → `stopAll` (the global kill switch the UI button binds to). Ingest only — in-flight chat untouched.
4. **No over-claim / durable resume** — gnome-sync no longer marks files embedded at dispatch. It
   persists a **pre-embed baseline** (deletes + dormant refreshes applied; the about-to-embed files
   deliberately **absent** from state) then finalizes per **confirmed** doc via new `embedFiles(...)`
   hooks `{onDocComplete, onComplete}`. Crash mid-batch → the un-confirmed files re-appear as
   new/changed in the next delta and retry (verified against `computeDelta`). Responds **202** with the
   *plan* (`{mode, queued, deleted, remaining, tracked}`), not `added`.
5. **Bounded request-thread work** — default batch capped at **`GNOME_SYNC_CAP`** (200) with a
   `remaining` "continue next sync" contract; an **explicit `limit`** keeps the old dormant-baseline
   semantics (overflow recorded `docpath:null`, not auto-pulled). Caps the `materialize()` loop too.
6. **Non-GNOME dormancy** — `GnomeBridge.ensureIndexer({restart})` runs the documented
   `systemctl --user` start/restart of `localsearch-3` and polls `available()`; **gated behind a
   `reconcile` body flag** (off by default — never restart a system service silently; deferred to an
   explicit "Re-index" action per [[k-base-ingest-safety]]).

**Decisions taken (the 3 flagged "to confirm"):** cool-down **750ms/doc** env-overridable, **0 in dev**;
default cap **200 + `remaining`**; STOP scope = **both** per-workspace and system-wide (UI uses the
system-wide one).

**Verification done:** `node --check` on all 5 changed files; logic checks (`computeDelta` retries an
unconfirmed pending file + flags an advanced-mtime managed file as changed; the worker loop lands
cool-downs *between* items / skips the last / halts on stop; `EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS` parsing).

**✅ LIVE-STACK E2E PASSED (2026-06-16)** on the running dev server against `/mnt/space/teaching_docs`
(`EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS=2000` to make a batch observably in-flight; server run as plain `node` for exact
kill control). Both failure paths exercised end-to-end — THE #1 RULE is now proven on a running stack,
not just logic-checked:
- **`kill -9` mid-batch (durable resume / no over-claim):** `limit:25` index, killed at 4-confirmed.
  State listed **exactly 4** (docpath set); the 21 in-flight files were **absent entirely** (never
  falsely marked done); **no orphan `embedding-worker` process survived** (killing the parent server
  took the inference child with it). On restart the workspace held **exactly 4** embedded docs (state
  matched reality — no over-claim *and* no under-claim), and the resume dryRun returned
  `mode:sync, queued:21` → the un-confirmed files reappeared and the batch finished to **25/25 with
  all-distinct URLs + docpaths, zero double-embeds**. (Title-level "duplicates" were genuinely distinct
  past-paper files sharing PDF-title metadata — URL is the identity key, and all 25 URLs were unique.)
- **`POST /system/stop-all` mid-batch (hard STOP):** returned `{stopped:["stop-test"]}`, the worker
  child (a real pid) **died instantly**, the **server stayed up and responsive** (ingest-only — STOP
  does not crash the server or touch in-flight chat), state stayed truthful (4 confirmed == 4 embedded),
  and a resume dryRun re-saw the 21 un-confirmed → STOP is durable too.

Net result: no over-claim, no silent file loss, no double-embed, no runaway inference process, server
survives STOP. **The live-stack/human-eyeball item under NEXT #2 is CLOSED.** Remaining open work moves
to **NEXT #3 = the UI/Electron flow** (folder picker + upfront banner + STOP button) and the
launch/periodic **cadence scheduler** that resumes pending files on relaunch.

### ✅ BUILT + EYEBALLED LIVE (2026-06-17) — `gnome-sync` UI/Electron flow (NEXT item #3)

The whole "ride on GNOME" backend was reachable only via CLI/CDP harnesses — **no way for a user to
trigger it in the app.** This wires it into the UI, and the whole flow (incl. the STOP kill switch) was
**driven live in the running Electron app and verified** (see "Verification" below). No engine changes — it
drives the already-live, already-E2E'd endpoints (`gnome-sync`, `/system/stop-all`, `embed-progress`).

- **Entry point (decided: a deliberate menu/settings action, not the drop zone):** a **"📂 Sync a
  folder"** button in the sidebar under "＋ Add documents" (`amadocs-ui/index.html`). Desktop-only — gated
  on `window.amadocs.pickFolder`, so it stays hidden in the browser dev stack (which can't resolve an
  absolute folder path or reach a native picker).
- **Native folder picker:** `main.js` `ipcMain.handle("pick-folder")` → `dialog.showOpenDialog({properties:
  ["openDirectory"]})`; exposed as `window.amadocs.pickFolder()` in `preload.js` (mirrors the existing
  `reveal-in-folder`/`open-folder` bridges).
- **Target collection (decided: pick existing OR new):** the sync modal lists existing workspaces
  (`GET /workspaces`) + a "➕ New collection…" option (created via `POST /workspace/new` at Sync time).
  Because the UI was hard-pinned to one workspace, `WS_SLUG`/`WS_NAME` are now **`let` (mutable)** and a new
  **`setActiveWorkspace(slug,name)`** re-points them + reloads the doc list — so a just-synced folder is
  immediately visible/chattable (a minimal collections-switch, not the full sidebar switcher in TODO #2).
- **Upfront banner (THE #1 RULE, said out loud):** the modal fires **`dryRun:true`** (the read-only plan
  contract) and renders honest counts — *"N files will be indexed now (M more after — run again to
  continue), and K no longer on disk will be removed. Large batches can keep your computer busy — you can
  stop anytime."* A brand-new collection shows a generic "index everything (up to 200 at a time)" line (no
  prior state to diff). dryRun is **always `reconcile:false`** (never restart a service just to preview).
- **Dormant-indexer UX (the non-GNOME caveat):** a dryRun on a box where LocalSearch isn't running returns
  503 → the banner says *"your file indexer isn't running"* and auto-ticks a **"Re-scan the disk first
  (slower)"** checkbox, which sets `reconcile:true` on the real run (the deliberate, explicit re-index per
  [[k-base-ingest-safety]] — never silent).
- **Progress + STOP:** on Sync it switches to chat and shows an `addSystemMsg` status bubble. The bubble now
  supports an inline **STOP** button (new `onStop` option → `POST /system/stop-all`, THE #1 RULE kill
  switch) and an **addAction** helper for a **"Continue"** button when `remaining > 0`. Progress is read from
  the **`embed-progress` SSE** channel (opened *before* the `gnome-sync` POST so no events are missed;
  `addSSEConnection` also replays buffered events): `batch_starting`/`doc_starting`/`doc_complete` drive an
  "Indexed X of Y" counter (note: worker `docIndex` is **0-based** — display is `+1`), `all_complete`/
  `stopped` settle the bubble. EventSource auths via `?token=` (it can't set headers; the gate accepts it).
- **✅ EYEBALLED LIVE (2026-06-17)** on the running Electron app against the real OS index (648 docs under
  `/mnt/space/teaching_docs`). CDP harnesses `tooling/eyeball-sync.js` + `eyeball-stop.js` (raw DevTools, no
  puppeteer — the native folder dialog can't be driven over CDP and `window.amadocs` is a frozen
  contextBridge object that can't be monkeypatched, so the test calls the real post-pick `showSyncModalFor()`
  with a fixed path; this is why `openSyncModal` was split into picker + `showSyncModalFor`). Verified, with
  screenshots in `tooling/logs/sync-*.png` + `stop-final.png`:
  - **dryRun banner with real counts:** *"200 files will be indexed now (429 more after — run Sync again to
    continue). Large batches can keep your computer busy — you can stop anytime."* (648 indexed − novels −
    cap 200 = 429 remaining). New-collection path shows the generic "index everything" banner. ✓
  - **Sync executes + progress counter advances:** "📂 Indexed 200 files into 'Teaching Eyeball'. 430 more
    remain." with the **Continue** button (the `remaining>0` path). ✓
  - **Workspace switch:** the app switched to the new collection and **200 docs rendered in the sidebar** —
    synced docs immediately visible/chattable. ✓
  - **STOP (THE #1 RULE) end-to-end:** with `EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS=3000`/`GNOME_SYNC_CAP=40` for a wide window,
    the STOP button renders **live mid-sync** ("📂 Indexed 3 of 40…"); clicking it halted the batch and the
    bubble settled to err-toned *"Sync stopped. Your collection keeps whatever was indexed so far — run Sync
    again to continue."* with **exactly 3 docs kept** (durable, no over-claim — matches the prior endpoint-level
    kill test). ✓
  - Note (harness, not a product bug): `Page.captureScreenshot` is flaky **during** active embedding on this
    box (renderer busy) — screenshot after the batch settles, or retry. The UI itself never stalled.
  - `node --check` on `main.js`, `preload.js`, and the extracted UI script all pass; UI copies synced
    (`tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html` → `amadocs-desktop/ui/`). Test workspaces cleaned up afterward.
- **Still open:** the **cadence scheduler** (resume pending files on relaunch) and the cosmetic `p.N`
  bridged-doc citation label (poppler).

#### Original plan (kept for reference)

Detailed, code-grounded plan for the safety wiring ([[k-base-ingest-safety]] — THE #1 RULE).
Verified the live code; the serial worker already exists, so this builds *on*
it rather than replacing it.

**The actual gaps (confirmed in code):**
1. **Over-claims completion (the big one).** `EmbeddingWorkerManager.embedFiles()` is **fire-and-forget**
   — it returns right after `worker.send({type:"embed"})` (`EmbeddingWorkerManager.js:149`), before any
   embedding happens. But the gnome-sync endpoint then *immediately* `Gnome.saveState()` with every file
   marked `docpath`-set and responds `added: adds.length` (`workspaces.js:461,490,497`). So **state records
   files as embedded before they are**; a crash leaves state lying, the file's mtime is unchanged, and the
   next delta never retries it. Also breaks durable/resume-at-relaunch.
2. **No cool-down.** Worker loop runs files back-to-back (`embedding-worker.js:64`).
3. **No hard STOP.** Only per-file `removeQueuedFile`; no kill-the-child / halt-all. (`worker.kill("SIGTERM")`
   already used for scheduled jobs at `BackgroundWorkers/index.js:315,355` — mirror it.)
4. **Unbounded upfront work in the request thread.** Endpoint materializes *all* `toEmbed` synchronously
   (2 SPARQL + a JSON write per file, `workspaces.js:459`) before embedding starts; bounded only if `limit`
   is passed.
5. **Non-GNOME dormancy.** On a non-GNOME box inotify doesn't fire; the endpoint reads a stale index unless
   LocalSearch is poked/restarted first. Not handled today.

**Design decision: keep it async + SSE, finalize state on confirm.** The established pattern
(upload-and-embed, today's gnome-sync) is async + SSE progress, not a blocking request. A safe batch can
run for *hours* (the #1 RULE case), so we must NOT hold the HTTP request open. Respond immediately with the
*plan*; a listener finalizes state per confirmed doc — which gives durability for free (un-confirmed files
reappear in the next delta and retry).

**The change set:**
1. **`jobs/embedding-worker.js`** — after each doc (success or fail) `await sleep(cooldownMs)` before the
   next (skip after the last); read `cooldownMs` from the `embed`/`add_files` message (default ~750ms;
   0 = off for dev). Add a `stop` message type: clear `queue`, set a stopping flag the loop checks between
   items, emit `stopped`, `process.exit(0)` (belt-and-suspenders with the parent `kill`).
2. **`utils/EmbeddingWorkerManager.js`** — `embedFiles(slug, files, wsId, userId, hooks?)` gains optional
   in-process hooks `{onDocComplete(docpath), onDocFailed(docpath,err), onComplete(summary)}` invoked from
   the existing `worker.on("message")` switch (`:113`) — no protocol change for other callers. Thread
   `cooldownMs` (env `EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS`) into the payloads. Add `stopWorkspace(slug)` and `stopAll()`:
   send `{type:"stop"}` then `worker.kill("SIGTERM")`, clear `runningWorkers`+`eventHistory`, emit `stopped`.
3. **`endpoints/workspaces.js` (gnome-sync)** — dryRun path unchanged. Execute path: (a) `removeDocuments(toDelete)`;
   (b) **persist a pending baseline immediately** — `saveState` with each `toEmbed` url as `docpath:null` +
   deletes applied (durable: crash here → those files look un-embedded next run); (c) materialize → build a
   `urlByDocpath` map, **bounded by default** (if `limit` is 0/unset apply a sane cap, e.g. 200, and report
   `remaining`); (d) `embedFiles(..., {onDocComplete: set nextFiles[url]={docpath,mtime} + debounced saveState;
   onComplete: final saveState})`; (e) respond **202** with the *plan* `{mode, queued, deleted, indexed, remaining}`
   — NOT `added`. Progress over the existing SSE channel.
4. **`utils/GnomeBridge/index.js`** — `ensureIndexer({restart})`: if `!available()` (or `restart`), run the
   documented `systemctl --user set-environment XDG_SESSION_CLASS=user` + `start`/`restart localsearch-3.service`,
   poll `available()` with a timeout; try/catch → degrade to the current 503. Gated by a `reconcile` body flag
   (off by default; UI requests it). Closes Gap 5. *(Note: [[k-base-ingest-safety]] deprioritizes this to a
   later explicit "Re-index" button — keep it behind the flag, don't auto-restart silently.)*
5. **Global STOP endpoint** — `POST /workspace/:slug/embedding-stop` → `stopWorkspace(slug)`; and
   `POST /system/stop-all` → `stopAll()`. The #1 RULE kill switch for *ingest* (not in-flight chat).

**Out of scope (NEXT item #3 / UI):** folder picker, the upfront banner (calls gnome-sync `dryRun:true`
first → confirm → real run; the dryRun contract is the seam, already supported), STOP-button binding, and
the launch/periodic cadence scheduler (the cadence is what *resumes* pending files on relaunch — enabled by
the finalize-on-confirm work here).

**Decisions to confirm before building:** (1) default cool-down value + per-doc vs per-N (proposing 750ms
per-doc, env-overridable, 0 on dev); (2) default batch cap when `limit` unset (proposing 200 + a `remaining`/
continue contract); (3) STOP scope — per-workspace + system-wide (lean: build both, UI uses system-wide).

**Verification when built:** unit (cool-down skips last item; `stop` clears queue+exits; `computeDelta`
retries a file whose pending state never confirmed); E2E on `/mnt/space/teaching_docs` (the existing
NEW→CHANGED→DELETED cycle, **plus** kill the server mid-batch → next sync re-embeds exactly the un-confirmed
files, **plus** hit STOP mid-batch → worker child dies and state stays truthful).

## Strategy

Fork the **AnythingLLM** engine (MIT) for the hard parts (ingestion, OCR, embeddings, vector
store, RAG) and build a **purpose-built simple UI + Electron wrapper + bundled local LLM** on
top. We are *integrators/packagers*, not reinventing the RAG stack. The product value is
ruthless simplicity for non-technical users.

Each **collection** = an AnythingLLM "workspace" = its own LanceDB table (isolated, scoped search).

## Repo layout (`/mnt/space/k-base/`)

- `anythingllm-upstream/` — forked engine (server / collector / frontend). We use server+collector.
- `amadocs-desktop/` — the Electron app. `main.js`, `loading.html`, `ui/index.html`.
- `tooling/` — dev helpers:
  - `ollama/bin/ollama` — userspace Ollama 0.30.7 (no sudo). Models in `tooling/ollama-models/`.
  - `amadocs-ui/index.html` — **source of truth for the UI** (copied into `amadocs-desktop/ui/`).
  - `start-stack.sh` — runs the 3 services as dev servers; logs in `tooling/logs/`. **Now pins
    `nvm use 22`** (was EOL 18.18.0). `yarn` under Node 22 comes from **`corepack enable`** (one-time;
    pulls yarn 1.22.22) — without it the stack dies with "yarn: command not found". It expects
    Ollama already serving on :11434 with `OLLAMA_MODELS=tooling/ollama-models` (start it separately:
    `tooling/ollama/bin/ollama serve`).
  - `cdp.js` / `ask.js` / `leakscan.js` — dev-run drivers (added 2026-06-14). `cdp.js` drives the
    live Electron UI over the DevTools port (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`) via Node 22's global
    `WebSocket`. `ask.js`/`leakscan.js` hit `stream-chat` to capture raw model output / scan for the
    phi3.5 leak. **Both send a fresh `sessionId` per call** — without it, the non-thread chat path
    accumulates `api_session_id:null` history and replays it, ballooning the prompt to 3800+ tokens
    and slowing every subsequent call (a test-harness footgun, and live proof that the UI's
    per-launch `SESSION_ID` scoping matters for perf, not just memory).
  - `test-docs/` — sample files. `dept-reports.pdf` (10 pages, unique prose + one buried fact
    per page) is the citation/jump-to-page test asset; `test-curriculum.pdf` is image-only
    (no text layer — useless for text/citation tests).

## Prerequisites

- **Node 22** (via nvm). `nvm install 22`. Electron spawns the engine with the bundled Node
  binary, which is now Node 22.
  - **Migrated off Node 18 (EOL) to Node 22 — DONE, packaged AppImage rebuilt + verified
    end-to-end, 2026-06-14.** The "doesn't build on Node 26" lore is about *source* builds —
    every native module the engine ships (`@lancedb/lancedb`, `sharp`, `canvas`,
    `onnxruntime-node`, `@prisma/client`) is a **prebuilt N-API binary**, ABI-stable across Node
    majors. All five load *and run* unchanged on Node 22 (**and 24**) with **no rebuild**, and a
    full server+collector boot + ingest + retrieval + grounded chat passed end-to-end on the
    **packaged Node 22 AppImage** with no problems. So the EOL-18 exit was just "swap the bundled
    binary," not a rebuild project. See `PACKAGING.md` → Node 18 EOL.
- Ollama (bundled in `tooling/`), with `phi3.5` pulled.

## Run it

**As the desktop app (the real thing):**
```bash
cd /mnt/space/k-base/amadocs-desktop
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 22
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 DISPLAY=:1
setsid nohup ./node_modules/.bin/electron . > /mnt/space/k-base/tooling/logs/electron.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```
Electron cold-boots the whole engine (~8s) and opens the window. If a dev stack is already
running, it reuses it.

**As a dev stack (for fast UI iteration in a browser):**
```bash
bash /mnt/space/k-base/tooling/start-stack.sh          # server/collector/frontend
cd /mnt/space/k-base/tooling/amadocs-ui && python3 -m http.server 8080   # the AMAdocs UI
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## Engine config (`anythingllm-upstream/server/.env.development`)

`LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` · `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF=phi3.5` · `EMBEDDING_ENGINE=native` ·
`VECTOR_DB=lancedb` · `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`. Changing server code/config needs an Electron
restart (server runs as plain `node`, not nodemon).

## Custom changes to the fork

- `server/models/systemSettings.js`: rewrote `saneDefaultSystemPrompt` into a **hard-grounded
  default** (answer ONLY from provided context, no outside/general knowledge, say so if the
  answer isn't in the docs, be concise). Goal: stop chatty/generic answers and training-data
  fallback. **Wiring gotcha:** `chatPrompt()` uses `workspace.openAiPrompt ?? saneDefault`, and a
  workspace bakes `openAiPrompt` into its DB column at creation (`workspace.js:211`). So editing
  this default only affects *newly created* workspaces, not existing ones — to retest against an
  existing workspace, update its `openAiPrompt` (API/sqlite). Status: **in progress, uncommitted.**
  Live-tested on a fresh `grounding-check` workspace (David Copperfield PDF — a book the model
  knows): answers stayed grounded in the excerpt but phi3.5 still (a) named the work from outside
  the text (may be reading the filename via the `<document_metadata>` header) and (b) stayed
  verbose. phi3.5 verbosity is the core remaining issue.
- **Hard answer-length cap (2026-06-13) — settled product decision: AMAdocs is a *search tool*,
  not a chatbot; answers are ~one paragraph (~120 words), never an essay.** Enforced in 3 layers:
  (1) **Engine hard stop** — `server/utils/AiProviders/ollama/index.js` sets `num_predict: 200`
  (~120 words) in the `options` of BOTH `getChatCompletion` and `streamGetChatCompletion`. This
  is the real guarantee: the model physically cannot ramble, applies to every workspace/prompt.
  (2) **Prompt** — appended a concision clause to `saneDefaultSystemPrompt` ("search tool, not a
  chat… at most a short paragraph (~120 words), lead with the direct answer, don't pad/hedge").
  Subject to the same openAiPrompt-baking gotcha (existing workspaces need their `openAiPrompt`
  updated; `vision-test` was updated live). (3) **UI trim** — `capAnswer()` in both UI copies
  trims the final answer to ≤120 words ending on the last full sentence, so a token-level cut
  never shows mid-word. **Verified live:** robot-photo Q → engine stopped phi3.5 at 125 words
  (was a multi-page essay); `capAnswer` → clean 109-word paragraph. **Still phi3.5-limited:**
  within the cap it wastes budget on meta-scaffolding and leaks the internal `CONTEXT 0/1` chunk
  labels into the answer — a quality/prompt issue separate from length.
  - **✅ FIXED (2026-06-14 PM) — `stripScaffolding()` UI guard is the real fix.** Measured on the
    dev stack: phi3.5 leaks **4/12** answers, almost all the `Context 0/1/2` chunk-label parroting
    (worst on vague "tell me about the documents" queries; specific-fact questions stayed clean).
    - **Prompt clause (tried, INEFFECTIVE on phi3.5):** appended to `saneDefaultSystemPrompt` a
      *"never refer to 'the context', 'Context 0/1', chunk/document numbers"* instruction. Re-measured
      with it **baked into a fresh workspace → still 4/12.** phi3.5 ignores it. Kept as a cheap belt
      (and a stronger model may honour it), but it is NOT the fix. (Still subject to the openAiPrompt
      baking gotcha — new workspaces only; the packaged app makes `my-documents` fresh on first run.)
    - **UI guard (the guarantee):** new `stripScaffolding()` called inside `capAnswer()` (both UI
      copies) cuts the answer at the first hallucinated marker (`## Instruction/Task/Additional`,
      `Context \d`, `In your response:`, `(Increased difficulty)`, fake `System:/User:/Assistant:`
      turns) **and backs up to the last full sentence** so it never dangles. Catches a short leak that
      fits inside the 120-word cap (the exact failure the live AppImage showed). Unit-tested vs. the
      real leak text + clean/legit answers; the `Context \d` marker requires a digit, so no false
      positive on the word "context". **Still TODO: eyeball the strip in the live UI** (it's only been
      unit-tested + applied to captured raw model output, not watched in the browser).
    - **✅ EYEBALLED LIVE + a UX cost found (2026-06-17):** watched in the running UI, the strip *works*
      but the user found it **confusing** — phi3.5 leaks the scaffolding into the stream, then the guard
      retroactively trims it, so text **appears and then visibly disappears mid-answer**, which erodes
      trust in the answer. By contrast **Granite (`granite4.1:3b`) "sticks to the source text much more
      cleanly"** (user's words) and mostly doesn't leak at all → nothing to claw back, the answer just
      streams straight through. **Lesson: fixing the leak at the source (a cleaner model) is strictly
      better UX than the post-hoc UI strip.** Strong argument for promoting Granite from candidate to the
      bundled default; the `stripScaffolding()` guard stays as a belt for whatever model is loaded, but it
      is a band-aid, not the answer. See [[k-base-granite-eval]] in product memory.
- `server/endpoints/workspaces.js`: added `GET /workspace/:slug/doc-view?path=<docpath>` →
  returns a document's extracted text **plus per-page char ranges** (`pages:[{page,start,end}]`)
  for the viewer and the citation jump-to-page (uses `fileData()`, path-traversal safe).
- `GET /workspace/:slug/doc-original?path=` → streams the **retained original file** with its
  content-type (powers the "Text and images" PDF/image/docx/xlsx render).
- `collector/utils/files` + `processSingleFile`: retain originals (stash → commit under
  `server/storage/originals/<docId><ext>` → discard on failure); `asPDF` writes the per-page
  ranges. `update-embeddings` deletes the matching original on doc removal.
- **API auth gate (2026-06-14) — `server/index.js`.** A single-secret middleware on the
  `/api` router: when `AMADOCS_API_TOKEN` is set, every request must present it
  (timing-safe compare; `Authorization: Bearer <t>` or `?token=<t>` for the export
  download anchor, which can't send a header); `OPTIONS` preflight passes through.
  **Token unset => passthrough**, so the dev stack is unchanged (mirrors the engine's own
  `validatedRequest` dev-passthrough convention). The packaged app mints the token per
  boot in `main.js` and threads it to both the engine env and the renderer (preload
  `window.amadocs.apiToken`); the UI attaches it via a `fetch` shim + `apiUrl()`. Closes
  the open-localhost hole (Fable review #3). See `PACKAGING.md`.
- `server/endpoints/workspaces.js`: **model picker + download** (added 2026-06-13). A curated
  `AMADOCS_MODEL_CATALOG` (MIT/Apache only — the single source of truth for what's offered)
  drives `GET /system/model-catalog`; `POST /system/pull-model` proxies `ollama /api/pull` as an
  SSE progress stream and **refuses any model not in the catalog** (licensing guard — keeps the
  non-commercial `qwen2.5` out). Swapping uses the existing per-workspace lever.
  **Gotcha:** the swap is the workspace's `chatModel` column, NOT `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF`. A pinned
  `chatModel` overrides the env default, so `update-env` silently no-ops against an existing
  workspace (verified live). The UI sets `chatModel` (+ `chatProvider:"ollama"`) via the normal
  `/workspace/:slug/update`.
- **Chat-memory model (2026-06-13) — session-scoped for docs, none for images.** Symptom: the AI
  "regurgitated previous conversations even in a different session." Root cause: the non-thread
  `/workspace/:slug/stream-chat` path fetched history by **workspace only** (`recentChatHistory`
  filters `user_id:null, thread_id:null, api_session_id:null`) and stored turns with
  `api_session_id:null`, so the last `openAiHistory||20` turns in `workspace_chats` replayed into
  every prompt **forever, across app restarts**. The AMAdocs UI had no session/new-chat concept at
  all. Fix (all runtime, so **NOT subject to the openAiPrompt-baking gotcha** — applies to every
  existing workspace immediately):
  - **Session scoping** — UI generates a per-launch `SESSION_ID` (`crypto.randomUUID`, held in
    memory, NOT localStorage → new every relaunch) and sends it in the `stream-chat` body. The
    non-thread endpoint (`endpoints/chat.js`) reads `sessionId` and threads it into
    `streamChatWithWorkspace(…, sessionId)`, which passes `apiSessionId` to BOTH `recentChatHistory`
    and every `WorkspaceChats.new`. Result: a fresh launch never sees an earlier sitting; the old
    `api_session_id:null` rows are simply never matched again (orphaned, harmless — no DB surgery).
    The threaded endpoint already scoped by `thread_id`, left untouched.
  - **Images get NO memory** — `streamChatWithWorkspace` computes `imageGrounded = sources.length>0
    && sources.every(amadocsIsImageSource)` (helper matches an image file-ext on the source `title`
    OR the `Image description:` / `Text found in image:` markers `asImage` writes; the per-chunk
    `title` is the reliable signal since every image chunk carries its filename). When
    image-grounded: history is dropped from the prompt (`promptRawHistory`/`promptChatHistory` → []),
    AND the turn is **not persisted** (`!imageGrounded` guard on the final `WorkspaceChats.new`) so
    it can't pollute a later text question in the same session. Rationale (user call): a photo has
    limited metadata and "nothing to discuss," and the model can't see it anyway.
  - **Image "you can't see it" clause** — when image-grounded, `AMADOCS_IMAGE_PROMPT` is appended to
    the system prompt in-flight: the context is an *automated text description*, the model CANNOT
    view the image, relay the description/detected text, don't claim to look at it or invent visual
    detail. Injected at runtime (not in `saneDefaultSystemPrompt`), so no baking gotcha.
  - Files: `server/utils/chats/stream.js`, `server/endpoints/chat.js`, `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`
    (→ synced to `amadocs-desktop/ui/`). **Verified:** image-detection unit cases pass; engine
    syntax-checks; clean cold boot; `stream-chat` with `sessionId` returns valid SSE (no 500).
    **Not yet eyeballed live:** the in-UI behaviour with real photos/docs (mixed-source retrieval
    falls to the doc/session-memory path by design — tune the all-images rule after watching it).

## Headline feature — grounded visual citation loop

The differentiator (see `K-base.md` / product memory): an answer's citation chip jumps to the
**original document, scrolls to the cited passage, and highlights it** in the in-app PDF viewer.

- UI-only logic in `tooling/amadocs-ui/index.html`: `resolveCitations` → `matchPage`
  (chunk→page via the `pages` ranges) for the chip's `p.N` label; on click,
  `renderPdf` renders the **PDF.js text layer** over the page-window canvases and highlights the
  spans of the cited chunk (`findPassageRegion` + `owner[]` span map), scrolling to the first hit.
- **Known limitation:** the chip's page number maps to where the retrieval *chunk starts*, so on
  sparse pages (chunk spans 2–3 pages) it can read 1–2 pages early — the passage highlight covers
  the real fact's page regardless, which is why highlighting (not the number) is the source of
  truth. Page jump is **PDF-only**; other types fall back to plain open. Matcher validated in Node
  against real PDF.js extraction. **✅ EYEBALLED LIVE (2026-06-14 PM):** in the running packaged
  app, clicking a citation chip opened the PDF, scrolled to the cited page, and highlighted the
  passage with **pixel-accurate** word-by-word alignment (PDF.js text layer over the canvas).

## Retrieval pipeline & tuning (2026-06-13)

Audited the fork's retrieval path for the "re-find a specific fact in a messy pile" use
case (the real product objective — extractive recall, not chat/synthesis). The semantic
"concept→wording" bridge is the **embedder**'s job, not the LLM's; the LLM only runs after
retrieval. So retrieval quality is the lever, and the LLM can stay small.

**What the fork already has (`utils/vectorDbProviders/lance/index.js`):**
- Pure vector search — `vectorSearch(queryVector).distanceType("cosine").limit(topN)`.
  `topN` default **4**, `similarityThreshold` **0.25** (`schema.prisma`).
- **A real cross-encoder reranker, but OFF by default.** `rerankedSimilarityResponse()`
  over-fetches 10–50 candidates and re-scores them with `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
  (`utils/EmbeddingRerankers/native`) down to topN. Gated behind
  `workspace.vectorSearchMode === "rerank"`; schema default is `"default"` (off). The class
  is mis-named "EmbeddingReranker" — ms-marco-MiniLM is a genuine cross-encoder. ~1.6s/18docs
  on CPU per the in-code benchmark.
- **Embedder is a config swap, not an integration.** Default `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  (384-dim, 256-tok); `nomic-embed-text-v1` (768-dim, 8192-tok) is already supported, with
  `queryPrefix`/`chunkPrefix` (asymmetric query-vs-doc) plumbing present. Upgrading the bridge
  = pick the model + re-ingest, no new code.
- **Chunking:** LangChain `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, chunkSize **1000**, chunkOverlap
  **20** (effective default — no `text_splitter_chunk_overlap` row existed). 20 chars is tiny;
  a fact at a chunk boundary can be split out of any retrievable chunk.

**What's missing:** **hybrid search.** Retrieval is pure-vector; there's no keyword/BM25/FTS
lane even though LanceDB supports it. So the *exact-anchor* case (part numbers, codes, a
literal `XXX`) — which vectors smear — is unaddressed. NOTE: a quick reranker smoke test showed
the cross-encoder is strongly *anchor-aware* (it ranked the sentence containing the literal
token above a better concept match), so the reranker may already recover many exact-anchor
misses — measure on a real pile before deciding hybrid is worth building.

**Changes applied to the dev DB (config, not committed code — like the strict prompt):**
- `vectorSearchMode='rerank'` on all 3 workspaces → reranker now on. Applies to **existing
  embeddings immediately** (no re-ingest needed). Reranker model (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`,
  23 MB) pre-fetched into `storage/models/` so it works offline / no first-query stall.
- `text_splitter_chunk_overlap = 200` system setting (20→200, ~20% of chunk size). **Only
  affects newly-ingested docs** — existing docs keep old chunking until re-dropped.
- DB backed up first: `storage/anythingllm.db.bak-*`.

**Test-from-scratch gotcha — the vector cache.** `addDocumentToNamespace` reuses
`storage/vector-cache/<content-digest>.json` if present, so re-dropping the *same file* reuses
the **old chunks** and silently ignores a new overlap/chunk-size setting. To genuinely re-chunk,
clear `storage/vector-cache/` (moved aside to `vector-cache.bak-*` on 2026-06-13) **and**
delete+re-import the doc. Lever ranking by effort-vs-payoff: reranker (free toggle, done) >
chunk overlap (setting, done) > stronger embedder (config + re-ingest) > hybrid keyword (real
build, not started).

## API the UI uses (unauthenticated in dev single-user mode)

- `POST /api/workspace/new` `{name}` — create a collection
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/update` `{chatMode:"query"}` — docs-only answering (anti-hallucination)
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/upload-and-embed` (multipart `file`) — drag-and-drop ingest; **catalogs** the file (embeds only its ~120-word summary card, `mode:"summary"`) — full-text is opt-in via `doc-deep-search` (our reframe, 2026-06-15)
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/doc-deep-search` `{path}` — upgrade ONE cataloged file to **full-text** semantic search: re-embeds the whole file in place under the same docId, flips `metadata.amadocsSearchMode` to `deep` (our addition)
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/stream-chat` `{message}` — SSE chat
- `GET  /api/workspace/:slug` — list documents
- `GET  /api/workspace/:slug/doc-view?path=` — document text + per-page ranges + `aiSummary` (our addition)
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/doc-summarize` `{path,force}` — on-demand ~120-word doc summary (right-click "Summarize"); caches to `aiSummary` (our addition)
- `GET  /api/workspace/:slug/doc-export-embedded?path=` — download a COPY with the FULL metadata (summary + AI description + OCR + provenance + EXIF) embedded in the file's own native metadata via a shared `amadocs:` XMP namespace (PDF/jpg/png) + `docProps/custom.xml` (office); source untouched (our addition)
- `GET  /api/workspace/:slug/doc-original?path=` — stream the retained original file (our addition)
- `GET  /api/workspace/:slug/doc-export?path=` — zip of the original photo + a JSON sidecar (AI description, OCR text, original EXIF, source/provenance) (our addition)
- `POST /api/workspace/:slug/update-embeddings` `{deletes:[docpath]}` — remove docs from a collection
- `POST /api/system/custom-models` `{provider:"ollama"}` — list installed local models (built-in)
- `GET  /api/system/model-catalog` — curated permissive models offered for download (our addition)
- `POST /api/system/pull-model` `{model}` — SSE download progress; catalog-only allowlist (our addition)

## Notable UI behaviours (`amadocs-ui/index.html`)

- **Viewer toggle**: `🔤 Text only` ↔ `🖼️ Text and images` (extracted text vs. rendered original).
- **Deep search affordance**: a *cataloged* file (summary-only) shows a hover **"🔍 Deep search"** pill
  in the sidebar and a right-click **"🔍 Deep search this file"** item; once full-text it reads
  **"✓ Deep searched"**. See "THE SWAP" above.
- **Stop button**: while an answer streams, the send button (➤) becomes a red ⏹ that aborts the
  request (`AbortController`) and keeps the partial answer. Reverts when done.
- Filenames are escaped before going into `innerHTML` (`esc`/`escAttr`) — no markup injection.
- **Model picker** (topbar `🧠 <name> ▾`): lists installed models (friendly labels via
  `KNOWN_MODELS`; non-commercial `qwen2.5` filtered by `HIDDEN_MODELS`), one-click swap. A
  "Get another model…" entry opens a **download modal** (catalog rows with size/licence, live
  progress bar over the `pull-model` SSE); on completion it auto-switches to the new model.

## Performance (dev machine: GTX 1650 Ti, 3.5 GB VRAM)

- Model runs 100% on GPU. Cold start (first query / model load) ~30–70 s; warm queries ~1 s.
- Mitigation: `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m` (set in `main.js`) + a "warming up" hint on first question.
- **AMAdocs is a GPU app (decided): a GPU is recommended; we make no CPU-only performance
  claim and don't benchmark/target a CPU-only path.** It still runs on CPU via Ollama's
  fallback — just not advertised or measured as a supported experience. All numbers here are GPU.

## Known gotchas

- **Don't** use `pkill -f` / `pgrep -f` with the electron path in automation — it matches the
  controlling shell and kills it. Use explicit PIDs (`ss -ltnp`) or `setsid` to launch.
- New workspaces default to chatMode `automatic`, which routes tool-calling models into agent
  mode; the UI forces `query` mode.
- Phi-3.5 is verbose — a strict/concise system prompt (see "Custom changes" →
  `saneDefaultSystemPrompt`) reduces but does not eliminate it; in progress.

## ✅ BUILT (2026-06-15) — THE SWAP: catalog-by-default + opt-in Deep search — *the librarian reframe, made real*

The reframe ([[k-base-alpha-simplification]] in product memory; `K-base.md` §3) flips what happens at
ingest. **Default is now "catalog," not "full scan."** Dropping a file gets it a ~120-word summary and
embeds **only that summary card** as the file's searchable content — cheap, bounded, one tiny chunk —
so the AI librarian can find any file the instant it's dropped, even on weak hardware. **Full-document
embedding (the old default) is now opt-in per file**, via a right-click **"🔍 Deep search"** action.

**The mechanism (a genuinely small swap — `upload-and-embed` does two things, and we split them):**
1. **Catalog at ingest.** `Document.addDocuments(workspace, additions, userId, {mode})` gained a 4th
   arg. `upload-and-embed` now passes `mode:"summary"`, which embeds `catalogText(data)` (the doc's
   `title` + `aiSummary`, falling back to a 2000-char leading slice when there's no summary — covers
   images, whose short vision caption *is* their gist, and the case where the summarizer was down).
   The on-disk document JSON keeps its **full** `pageContent` (viewer/citations unchanged); only the
   *embedded* text is the card. The chosen mode is tagged on `workspace_documents.metadata` as
   **`amadocsSearchMode`** (`"summary"` | `"deep"`). Summaries themselves now generate **by default**
   at ingest — `DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED` default flipped to **true** (`#attachOptions` `?? "true"
   !== "false"`; start-stack.sh / packaged main.js / collector/.env). Other `addDocuments` callers
   keep the `"deep"` default, so only the AMAdocs drop path is cataloged.
2. **Deep search on demand.** New `POST /workspace/:slug/doc-deep-search {path}` re-embeds the full
   file **in place under the same docId**: `deleteDocumentFromNamespace` → `prisma.document_vectors.
   deleteMany({docId})` (the namespace delete doesn't clear the DB mapping) → `addDocumentToNamespace(
   …, skipCache=TRUE)` → flip `metadata.amadocsSearchMode` to `"deep"`. The `workspace_documents` row
   and the retained original are untouched, so deletion / viewer / "Save copy" all keep working.
   ⚠️ **`skipCache=true` is mandatory:** the vector cache is keyed on the **docpath**
   (`uuidv5(filename)`), *not* the content, so without it the re-embed would just restore the cached
   summary chunks instead of embedding the full text. (`storeVectorResult` then overwrites the cache
   entry with the full chunks, which is what we want.)
3. **UI** (`amadocs-ui/index.html` → synced to desktop). `loadDocuments` reads `amadocsSearchMode`
   from each doc's metadata into `docModeByPath` (legacy pre-reframe docs have no flag → treated as
   `"deep"`, since they *were* fully embedded). Cataloged rows show a hover **"🔍 Deep search"** pill;
   the right-click menu shows **"🔍 Deep search this file"** or a disabled **"✓ Deep searched"**.
   `deepSearchDoc()` POSTs behind a timer status bubble ([[k-base-status-feedback]]) then reloads.
   Upload copy now reads "Cataloged N documents… Right-click any file → 🔍 Deep search…".

**Behaviour note:** a cataloged doc's citations **won't page-jump** (the AI-written summary isn't
verbatim in the doc, so `matchPage` finds nothing → the chip just opens the doc — graceful). Deep
search restores the full **passage-highlight** citation loop. That's by design and is *why* you'd
deep search a file. **Not yet wired** to the safe serial/durable ingest queue
([[k-base-ingest-safety]]) — summarization runs per-file at ingest as before, just on by default;
when the queue lands, summaries + the global STOP ride on the same worker.

**Verified:** all 6 server/UI files syntax-check; extracted UI JS parses; `catalogText` branch
unit-test **6/6**; only the drop path is cataloged. **NOT yet live-E2E'd** in the running app (the
"needs a human eyeball" class) — drop → catalog (1-chunk embed) → librarian find → Deep search →
full-passage citation.

## ✅ BUILT (2026-06-14) — Per-document AI summary (catalog card) — *the `aiSummary` mechanism (now the catalog default — see "THE SWAP" above)*

A document can be given a short (~120-word) factual "catalog card" summary, stored as a new
**`aiSummary`** field on the document JSON. It's metadata *about* the file — what it is and what
it covers. Reuses the same ~120-word standard as the chat answer cap. **As of 2026-06-15 this is the
catalog DEFAULT** (the summary is what gets embedded for a freshly dropped file — see "THE SWAP").
The on-demand right-click "Summarize" path below still exists (e.g. to (re)generate a summary for a
deep-searched or legacy doc).

**Trigger history:** originally **ON DEMAND** (right-click "Summarize"), with auto-at-ingest behind
`DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED=true` (default **false**) — auto-summarising every upload adds a ~25-30s LLM call
per document. **The reframe flipped this:** `DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED` now defaults **true** and the summary
is embedded as the catalog card. The on-demand `doc-summarize` endpoint remains for explicit
(re)summarise.

**On-demand path (the default):**
- **Server endpoint** `POST /workspace/:slug/doc-summarize` `{path, force?}` (`endpoints/workspaces.js`,
  next to `doc-view`): loads the doc via `fileData()` (path-traversal safe); returns the cached
  `aiSummary` immediately unless `force`; else generates with **the workspace's `chatModel`**
  (the model the user picked, falling back to `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF`), writes `aiSummary` back onto the
  doc JSON, and returns it. Best-effort: a null summary (e.g. model still downloading) returns
  `{summary:null, error:…}`, never a 500.
- **Server-side `server/utils/DocSummary/index.js`** — twin of the collector util (same leading-slice
  + prompt + `num_predict:200` + `trimToSentence`), used here because the server knows the workspace
  and so can use the exact chat model.
- **UI** (`amadocs-ui/index.html` → synced): a **"🧠 Summarize"** item added to the doc-row
  right-click menu (`showDocMenu`; hidden for images via `isImageName` — their vision caption already
  is their summary). `summarizeDoc()` shows a live **status bubble with a timer** (`addSystemMsg`,
  the proof-of-life pattern [[k-base-status-feedback]]) while the model works, then drops the summary
  into chat as an assistant bubble. `loadTextView()` also renders a persistent **"🧠 AI summary"**
  panel at the top of a document's text view whenever `aiSummary` exists.

**Auto-at-ingest path (opt-in, `DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED=true`).** Generated at the single funnel every
file drop passes through: `collector/processSingleFile/index.js`. After the converter returns,
`attachDocumentSummary()` summarises each `result.documents[*]`, strips the runtime-only fields
(`location`/`isDirectUpload`), writes `aiSummary` back onto the on-disk JSON, and reflects it on
the returned object. Covers every current + future converter automatically (no per-converter edits).

- **`collector/utils/DocSummary/index.js`** (new, mirrors `VisionCaption`) — POSTs the document's
  **leading slice** to Ollama `/api/generate` with a librarian "catalog card" prompt,
  `num_predict: 200` (~120 words out), `temperature: 0.2`. **Leading slice = first 5 pages when
  per-page char ranges exist (PDF), else first ~8000 chars (~2000 tokens)** — "summarise the first
  few pages, not a 200-page novel," and it bounds the per-file cost on a big drop. Output is
  `trimToSentence()`-trimmed (last full sentence) so a token-level cut never dangles — mirrors the
  UI's `capAnswer`. **Best-effort**: any failure (no model pulled, runtime down, timeout, <200 chars
  of input) returns `null` and **never breaks ingestion**.
- **Model (auto-at-ingest path):** the chat model, threaded via a new
  `summary:{enabled,model,ollamaBasePath}` block in the server's `#attachOptions`
  (`server/utils/collectorApi/index.js`), mirroring the `vision` block. `enabled` defaults to
  **false** (`DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED ?? "false") === "true"`). `SUMMARY_MODEL_PREF` →
  `OLLAMA_MODEL_PREF` → `phi3.5`. **No extra model to download** — same model as chat.
- **Skipped for:** images (their vision caption already *is* their summary — `VisionCaption.SUPPORTED`
  in the collector path, `isImageName` in the UI menu), parse-only/direct uploads.
- **Env knob `DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED`** (default **false** = on-demand only) in `collector/.env`,
  `start-stack.sh`, and packaged `main.js` `packagedEngineEnv`. Optional `SUMMARY_MODEL_PREF` override.
- **Exposed to the UI** via `doc-view` (`endpoints/workspaces.js` now returns `aiSummary`) and the
  `doc-summarize` POST endpoint — the APIs the semantic file browser will read/drive.

**Verified live (2026-06-14, phi3.5, running dev stack):**
- **On-demand (the default UX), full E2E through the running engine:** uploaded `dept-reports.pdf`
  with `DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED` unset → upload took **1s, zero `DocSummary` calls** at ingest,
  `doc-view` `aiSummary: null` (confirms default-off). `POST /doc-summarize` → generated a 98-word
  card with the workspace `chatModel` (30s); `doc-view` then returned the stored summary; a **second
  call returned `cached:true` instantly (0s)**; on-disk JSON persisted.
- **Auto-at-ingest path (opt-in):** `DocSummary.summarize()` on the 11,610-word IGCSE syllabus →
  accurate 127-word card; full `processSingleFile` run on a synthetic report → `aiSummary` on both
  the returned object and the on-disk JSON, clean sentence end. Slicing + sentence-trim unit-tested
  (page-cap stops at page 5, char-cap == 8000, tiny input → null, mid-sentence trimmed).
- **Caveat:** phi3.5 still embellishes within the cap (invented "Duke University" once) — known
  small-model issue, not wiring; mitigated by `temperature:0.2` + bounded input. **Not eyeballed
  live:** the right-click menu item / status bubble / summary panel *in the actual UI* (same
  "needs a human eyeball" class as the citation render). **Not built:** the file browser that
  consumes `aiSummary`; back-filling pre-existing docs (null until summarized — graceful).

### ✅ BUILT (2026-06-14, EXPANDED 2026-06-15) — Embed the FULL metadata INTO a copy of the file (right-click "Save copy with info")

Take a document back **out** of AMAdocs with **everything AMAdocs understands about it** — the AI
summary, the AI vision description, any OCR'd text, and source/provenance — written into the file's
**own native metadata**, so that understanding travels inside the file (visible in OS file managers /
other tools), not just in AMAdocs' store. **The user's source file is NEVER touched** — the server
reads its retained *copy* into a buffer, embeds, and streams a brand-new download. (Mirror of the
never-modify-originals stance; complements the photo-export *sidecar*, which keeps the full record in
a separate JSON — see below for why both exist.)

**Originally embedded only the summary (one flat field per format). Expanded 2026-06-15 to the full
payload via a shared schema** (user direction: "put the metadata into their own metadata formats").
The key realisation: there's no universal metadata model, **but XMP (Adobe's RDF/XML packet) is
natively carried by PDF, JPEG and PNG**, so those three share **ONE schema** — a custom `amadocs:`
namespace (+ standard `dc:description`) — and differ only in *how the packet is injected*. Office
(OOXML) doesn't use XMP; its native home for structured app metadata is **custom document properties**
(`docProps/custom.xml`). For every family we write **both** a standard slot (so generic tools show
something) **and** the full `amadocs:` payload, including a complete JSON blob in `amadocs:data` for a
lossless round-trip back into AMAdocs.

- **`server/utils/MetadataEmbed/index.js`** — `embedMetadata({buffer, ext, metadata})` (the old
  `embedSummary({…,summary})` is now a thin back-compat wrapper; `metadata` may be the full
  sidecar-shaped object OR a bare summary string):
  - **PDF** → injects an **XMP metadata stream** (`/Metadata` in the catalog) + sets Info `/Subject`
    (the slot file managers show) + `/Keywords` tag. Metadata-only, no re-render.
  - **PNG** → two hand-rolled **iTXt** chunks before `IEND`: `XML:com.adobe.xmp` (the full XMP) +
    `Description` (the display line). UTF-8, computed CRC32, no dep, no re-encode.
  - **JPEG** → an **APP1 XMP segment** (`http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/\0` + packet) inserted after SOI
    + EXIF `ImageDescription`/`Software` via `piexifjs`. **No pixel re-encode.**
  - **Office (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx)** → `jszip` writes `docProps/custom.xml` (registers the Override in
    `[Content_Types].xml` + a relationship in `_rels/.rels`) + sets `core.xml <dc:description>`.
- **Three robustness limits handled (all surfaced by live testing on real files):**
  1. **JPEG APP1 64 KB cap** — `buildXmpFitting()` sheds the heaviest field first (trim
     `extractedText` in halves → drop it → drop the JSON blob) so the segment always fits ≤65535.
     (PNG/PDF/Office have no such cap.)
  2. **No re-embedding a doc's own text** — `EMBED_TEXT_CAP = 16000` chars on `extractedText` for the
     embed path. Without it, embedding a 500-page PDF's extracted text **doubled the file** (4 MB →
     8.5 MB) for no gain (the text is already inside it). The **sidecar keeps the complete text**;
     the in-file copy is capped with a "full text in the sidecar export" note. Small photo OCR is far
     under the cap, so images embed their full OCR.
  3. **Control-char / encoding hygiene** — `deepSanitize()` strips XML-1.0-illegal control chars
     (LLMs occasionally emit stray bytes). **The real live bug:** pdf-lib, given the XMP as a JS
     *string*, re-encodes it with single-byte **PDFDocEncoding**, silently corrupting every non-Latin1
     char (em-dash U+2014 → byte `0x14`, curly quote U+2019 → `0x19`, ☕/café mangled). Fix: pass
     **`Buffer.from(xmp, "utf8")`** to `context.stream` so the exact UTF-8 bytes are stored. (PNG/JPEG
     paths already passed UTF-8 buffers, which is why only PDF was affected — and why it cost a long
     debug to find: the "control chars" were never in our data, they were mis-encoded Unicode.)
- **Shared extractor** — `amadocsExtractMetadata({data, slug, originalFile, ext})` in
  `endpoints/workspaces.js` is now the **single source of truth** for the payload (summary, AI
  description split out of `pageContent`, OCR text, provenance, EXIF via `exifr`, image facts via
  `sharp`). **Both** `doc-export` (sidecar JSON) and `doc-export-embedded` (native embed) call it, so
  the two exports can never drift.
- **Sidecar vs. embed — why BOTH stay:** the native embed carries the *gist* visible in
  Explorer/Finder/Office/`exiftool`; the **sidecar (`doc-export` zip) remains the lossless full
  record** — it survives JPEG's size cap, covers formats with no embed writer (HEIC/TIFF/txt/…),
  and survives tools that strip embedded metadata.
- **No new deps** — reuses `pdf-lib`/`jszip`/`piexifjs`/`exifr`/`sharp` already in the tree.
- **Server endpoint** `GET /workspace/:slug/doc-export-embedded?path=`: finds the retained original,
  415s an unsupported ext, **generates+caches `aiSummary` on the fly** if missing, builds the full
  metadata via the shared extractor, embeds, streams the copy as **`…-with-info.<ext>`** (`?token=`).
- **UI** (`amadocs-ui/index.html` → synced): **"💾 Save copy with summary"** item in the doc-row
  right-click menu (`canEmbedSummary`, supported formats only). `saveWithSummary()` fetches as a blob
  behind a timer status bubble, then downloads. *(UI label still says "summary" — rename to "info" is
  a trivial follow-up, batched with the inspect/edit UI below.)*

**Verified live end-to-end (2026-06-15, running dev stack):** standalone suite **26/26**
(PNG/JPEG/PDF/DOCX: XMP round-trips incl. Unicode ☕/café/em-dash, JPEG APP1 ≤65535 even with a huge
OCR, custom.xml registered, every file stays valid, input bytes untouched). Over HTTP against real
docs: **PNG/JPEG/PDF all 200**, `amadocs:data` parses, full payload present (docId, summary, AI
description, EXIF + image facts on the JPEG), PDF `extractedText` capped at 16 KB (4 MB original stays
4 MB), and the XMP packet validates as **well-formed XML**. **Not eyeballed live:** the actual
right-click → download in the UI (human-eyeball class). Standalone test: `tooling/test-metadata-embed.js`.

**⬜ Next (user-requested, not started): inspect + edit the metadata before export.** Let the user
**review the summary/description/OCR/provenance** in a panel before "Save copy with info" / sidecar
export, and **edit** fields (e.g. fix a phi3.5 embellishment) before they're written. The data path is
ready — `doc-summarize` (regenerate/cache) and the shared `amadocsExtractMetadata` already produce the
exact payload; this is a UI panel + a "save edited summary back to `aiSummary`" write.

**Cost note:** this adds one chat-model generation per non-image document at ingest (consistent
with vision running a model per image). For a big drop it's serial + best-effort; turn it off with
`DOC_SUMMARY_ENABLED=false`. When the queued/background ingest (the "dump 100 files" item) lands,
summaries ride along on the same worker.

**⬜ Follow-up idea (2026-06-14): surface summaries in the OS file manager (Nautilus).** The dev
box runs ML4W Hyprland → **Nautilus (GNOME Files) 50.2.2** (GTK4; launched via
`~/.config/ml4w/settings/filemanager`, Super+E). A `nautilus-python` extension (needs the
`python-nautilus` package, not yet installed) could add a right-click **"Summarize with AMAdocs"**
action + an **"AI Summary" column / tooltip / Properties tab** (`MenuProvider` / `ColumnProvider` /
`InfoProvider` / `PropertyPageProvider`). Engine seam already exists: the collector's
`parseDocument` (`/parse`, takes **absolutePath**, parses WITHOUT embedding) → `DocSummary.summarize`
→ cache the result as a `user.amadocs.summary` **xattr** on the file; the column reads the cached
xattr (fast, no recompute). **Guardrails:** must be **pull, not push** — inference only on explicit
right-click; the column reads **cached xattrs only, never auto-runs the model on directory view**
(auto-summarising everything you browse to = the exact lock-up/OOM/background-inference footgun that
PARKED [[k-base-folder-index]] / AI Finder). Note the existing `aiSummary` is keyed by AMAdocs docId
in private storage, NOT by disk path, so this is a *separate, in-place* data path, not a reuse of
those. Caveat: a Nautilus extension is **GNOME-only**, outside the cross-platform Electron bundle —
a Linux/GNOME power-user companion, not part of the shippable app.

## ✅ BUILT (2026-06-13) — AI image analysis (vision captioning) — *v2 feature #1*

Image-only files (photos, whiteboards, receipts, screenshots with no clean text layer) are now
**searchable by content**, not just OCR'd text. A local vision model describes the image; its
output is plain text, so it flows through the existing text→embed→retrieve→cite pipeline with
**zero engine/embedding/search changes**.

**What was the gap:** `asImage.js` ran tesseract OCR *only* and **rejected the file when OCR
found no text** — text-less images were dropped and never indexed.

**What was built:**
- **`collector/utils/VisionCaption/index.js`** (new) — POSTs the image (base64) to Ollama
  `/api/generate` (`images:[…]`, describe-in-detail prompt, `stream:false`). Best-effort:
  any failure (no model pulled, runtime down, timeout, 404) returns `null` and **never breaks
  ingestion**. Resolves the Ollama URL via `OLLAMA_BASE_PATH` → `OLLAMA_HOST` → local default,
  so it works in both the dev stack and the packaged app.
- **`asImage.js` rewritten** — runs OCR **and** caption in parallel, combines them into
  `pageContent` ("Image description:" caption + "Text found in image:" OCR). **Only fails if
  BOTH are empty** — text-less images are no longer dropped.
- **`collectorApi/#attachOptions()`** — added a `vision: { model, ollamaBasePath }` block
  (server env → collector), mirroring the existing `ocr` block. `VISION_MODEL_PREF` (default
  `moondream`) + `OLLAMA_BASE_PATH` added to `collector/.env` and `start-stack.sh`.
- **Catalog + picker** — `moondream` (Apache-2.0, `~1.7 GB`, `type:"vision"`) added to
  `AMADOCS_MODEL_CATALOG`. It's **downloadable** but kept **out of the chat picker** (added to
  `HIDDEN_MODELS`: `moondream`/`llava`/`bakllava`) and the download flow **does not switch the
  chat model to it** (`pullModel` branches on `m.type==="vision"`). LLaVA / Llama-3.2-Vision
  remain excluded — Llama-licensed, breaks the permissive-only stance.

**Verified live (2026-06-13, GTX 1650 Ti):** `moondream` pulled; `VisionCaption.caption()`
produced an accurate description of `test-docs/test-graphic.png` (~10 s cold, <1 s warm);
`asImage` returned `success:true` with combined caption+OCR `pageContent` for that text-less
graphic (previously it would carry only OCR garbage).

**Full data-path E2E verified (2026-06-13, GTX 1650 Ti).** Fresh `vision-test` workspace
(query mode, ollama/phi3.5): `upload-and-embed test-graphic.png` (text-less shapes graphic)
→ collector ran caption (moondream, 12.84s, 334 chars) + OCR (0.61s) in parallel and indexed
combined `pageContent` (OCR alone yielded only `® I`, so the file is answerable *only* via the
caption). `stream-chat` "what shapes and colours appear and where?" returned a grounded answer
naming the yellow circle / green rectangle / red triangle and **cited `test-graphic.png` as its
one source** — proving caption→embed→retrieve→cite end-to-end. (The answer faithfully echoed
moondream's caption quirks — "blue sky with clouds," triangle "top right" — confirming grounding
in the caption text, not the raw image.) **Still not run:** the literal in-browser click +
citation-highlight *render* — but that's the same separate "needs a human eyeball" item already
open for the citation loop, not a vision-specific gap.

**Open / next:** the "dump 100 photos" user still needs **background/queued ingest with
progress** (today uploads are serial with a per-row spinner). Vision inference is heavier than
text, so it especially wants a GPU — consistent with AMAdocs being a GPU app (we don't
benchmark or claim a CPU-only path).

## ✅ BUILT (2026-06-13) — OCR quality (engine-side) — *v2 feature #2 (partial)*

Raised scanned-document OCR accuracy with two well-established prep techniques, applied to
**both** OCR paths (`collector/utils/OCRLoader/index.js`). No new deps — `sharp` and
`tesseract.js` were already in the pipeline. All changes tagged `AMAdocs:`.

**What was built:**
- **Rasterization DPI bumped + made tunable.** `PDFSharp` hard-coded **70 DPI** (a slight
  *shrink* vs the 72 baseline — tuned for speed/memory, bad for small print). Now the default
  is **150** and it reads `OCR_PDF_DPI`, clamped to **[72, 300]** (below loses detail; above
  mostly bloats memory/time — and a 3.5 GB-VRAM-class box can OOM on huge pages, so the ceiling
  is a guard, consistent with the safety-first stance). `OCRLoader.parseDpi()` does the clamp;
  threaded into `PDFSharp` via a `dpi` constructor option.
- **Image preprocessing before `recognize`** — `OCRLoader.preprocessImage()`: `grayscale()` +
  `normalize()` (contrast stretch — recovers faded/low-contrast scans; Tesseract binarizes
  internally so we deliberately stop short of a hard threshold that wrecks uneven lighting), plus
  a **2× upscale for small images** (longest side < 1500px) so glyphs are big enough to read.
  Best-effort: any `sharp` failure returns the original input so OCR still runs. Wired into the
  standalone-image path (`ocrImage`); the scanned-PDF path gets the same grayscale+normalize
  inside `PDFSharp.pageToBuffer`.
- **Env knob documented** — `OCR_PDF_DPI` added to `collector/.env` (commented default) and
  `tooling/start-stack.sh` (`=150`). Lower it on low-RAM machines, raise it for tiny print.

**Verified (2026-06-13, Node 18):** module loads; DPI clamp correct (`70→72`, `150→150`,
`999→300`, unset→`150`); `preprocessImage` runs incl. the small-image upscale branch and is
**non-destructive** — a synthetic faded+blurred "Invoice 4471…" scan OCR'd **47/47 chars
identically** raw vs. preprocessed at both large and small sizes (no regression). **Honest
limit:** could **not** demonstrate a quantitative accuracy *gain* here — modern Tesseract LSTM
reads crisp *synthetic* text even when degraded, and real OCR failures (scanner noise, skew,
paper texture, JPEG artifacts) can't be convincingly synthesized. grayscale+normalize+DPI are
standard, well-founded prep; the payoff needs **real scanned documents** to quantify — same
"needs real-world test data" gap already open elsewhere in the project. No degraded-scan asset
exists in `tooling/test-docs/` (the PNGs are text-less shape graphics; `test-curriculum.pdf`
rasterizes but OCRs to nothing).

**Confidence noise-gate (added 2026-06-14) — the real fix for OCR artefacts on photos.**
A text-less portrait photo was producing ~1,200 words of Tesseract glyph garbage
("PEER EEE HEE EE Spey 11 ¢…") that got embedded and polluted retrieval. The earlier
`looksLikeText` char-heuristic in `asImage.js` let it through (fake uppercase runs satisfy
its "3+ four-letter words" + high letter-ratio test). Replaced it with Tesseract's own
**mean per-word confidence**, which separates the two cleanly (measured: text-less photos
score **~28-40**, genuine text **~85-95 even when blurred**):
- `OCRLoader.ocrImage()` now uses the default `recognize()` output (so `data.confidence`
  is populated — dropped the `"text"`-only restriction) and **returns
  `{text, confidence, reliable}`** instead of a bare string (its only caller is `asImage`).
- New env knob **`OCR_MIN_CONFIDENCE`** (default **50**, clamped [0,100], `0` disables;
  `parseConfidence()`). Added to `collector/.env`, `start-stack.sh`, and the packaged
  `main.js` `packagedEngineEnv`.
- `asImage` drops unreliable OCR **only when a caption exists**; with no caption it keeps
  low-confidence OCR rather than drop the file (never-drop guarantee). `looksLikeText` removed.
- **Verified live (2026-06-14):** re-ingested the offending photo → `pageContent` went
  **1264 → 41 words** (caption only); collector logs `-- Working unnamed.jpg -- (caption:
  yes, ocr: dropped-as-noise@28)`.

**Deferred (post-build-1):** surface OCR **language** as a UI setting. **Build 1 is
English-only (decided 2026-06-13)**, so this is parked, not unfinished. When wanted it's
**UI-only** plumbing in `amadocs-ui/index.html` (a language multi-select) — the engine already
honors it end-to-end (`TARGET_OCR_LANG` → server `#attachOptions` `ocr.langList` → `OCRLoader`);
no engine change. The default is already `eng`, so English-only needs zero work. Bigger
DPI/preprocessing wins are done — **feature #2 is complete for build 1.**

## 🎯 Post-build-1 priority (decided 2026-06-14): OCR + text analysis quality

Once build 1 ships, the **main focus is improving OCR and text analysis** — it's the core of the
product's value (reading real-world, messy documents well), and it's where the headroom is.

**State of the art (the plateau is narrow):** per-character accuracy on *clean printed Latin
text* is near-maxed — Tesseract (what we use via `tesseract.js`, LSTM) is at the ceiling there
and won't improve much by tuning. **Everything else is wide open:** layout/tables, handwriting,
degraded/photographed docs, reading order, math/formulas, charts, non-Latin scripts.

**Feasible improvement axes, ranked by effort-vs-payoff for our users (non-technical, dumping
real-world docs/photos), licensing-aware (keep the MIT/Apache-only stance):**
1. **More preprocessing — lowest-risk, biggest real-world win, stays light.** We already do
   DPI/grayscale/normalize/upscale + a confidence noise-gate (see OCR-quality section). Still on
   the table, all classic OpenCV-grade + permissive: **deskew, dewarp (curved book pages),
   perspective-crop / document-detection, adaptive binarization (Sauvola), denoising,
   super-resolution.** These move the needle most on the "snap a receipt/letter" case.
2. **Route hard docs to a deep-learning OCR engine via ONNX** — we already run onnxruntime.
   **PaddleOCR** (Apache-2.0; `PP-Structure` for tables/layout) exported to ONNX (RapidOCR/
   OnnxOCR), or **docTR**/**EasyOCR** (Apache-2.0). Better layout + multilingual without a VLM.
   (Watch **Surya**'s license — more restrictive/revenue-gated than Apache; vet before use.)
3. **VLM-as-deep-OCR for the worst cases (handwriting, tables→markdown, formulas→LaTeX)** — we
   already bundle a VLM path (moondream for captions); a doc-OCR-tuned small VLM (e.g. GOT-OCR2.0,
   Qwen2.5-VL-class, Apache where applicable) could be an **opt-in "deep read."** Collides with
   the 8 GB / zero-config / GPU-app constraints, so it's a power-user/GPU option, NOT the default.
4. **Structured extraction (tables/forms)** — high value for the records-search use case
   (invoices), and the part classic OCR doesn't do.

**The standing tension:** accuracy vs. footprint/simplicity. Tesseract's whole appeal is tiny +
CPU-fine + Apache-2.0 + no GPU; heavier engines/VLMs trade that away. Default stays light;
anything heavy is opt-in / config escape-hatch (consistent with [[k-base-modes-direction]]).
Tie-in: "text analysis" here also means the **retrieval/embedding** side ([[k-base-retrieval-tuning]]:
hybrid/keyword search still absent, stronger embedder is a config swap) — better OCR feeds better
text feeds better search.

## ✅ BUILT (2026-06-13) — Export photo with metadata

Lets the user take a photo back **out** of AMAdocs with everything the app understands about
it attached, so the AI's understanding travels *with* the file into other tools. **Sidecar
form** (decided with user): export a ZIP of the **original file (untouched)** + a readable
**JSON sidecar** — chosen over embedding into EXIF/XMP because it's format-agnostic
(PNG/JPG/HEIC/…) and robust. Build 1 scope addition (before packaging).

**Sidecar contents** (user-selected): `aiDescription` (moondream caption), `extractedText`
(OCR), original camera **EXIF**, and `source` provenance (filename, collection, ingest date,
docId, wordCount) + basic `image` facts (dimensions/format/space/density from sharp).

**What was built:**
- **Server** `GET /workspace/:slug/doc-export?path=` (`endpoints/workspaces.js`, next to
  `doc-original`): resolves the doc via `fileData()` (path-traversal safe), finds the retained
  original by uuid-prefix, splits `aiDescription`/`extractedText` back out of the combined
  `pageContent` (the `"Image description:"` / `"Text found in image:"` labels `asImage` writes;
  non-image docs carry their text as-is), reads EXIF (`exifr`, best-effort) + image facts
  (`sharp`, best-effort), and streams an **`archiver` zip** (original under its real name +
  `<base>.amadocs.json`) as an attachment. Originals are never modified — it's a copy.
- **One new dep:** `exifr@7` (pure-JS, **no native build** → dodges the Node-18 native-module
  fragility) — installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` (the tree's standard workaround). `archiver`
  was already present. (Added AMAdocs runtime deps: `exifr` here + later `piexifjs@1.0.6` for the
  embed-summary feature — both pure-JS, no native build. That's the full added-dep list.)
- **UI** (`amadocs-ui/index.html` → synced to `amadocs-desktop/ui/`): a `⬇️ Export with info`
  button in the viewer header, shown **only for images** (`curDoc.isImage`). Click builds an
  anchor to the endpoint; `Content-Disposition: attachment` makes a plain navigation download
  the zip — works in both the browser dev stack and Electron, no folder-picker needed.

**Verified live (2026-06-13):** real phone photo `IMG_5127.jpg` (`amadocs-test` ws). Restarted
the server with the new route; `GET …/doc-export` → **HTTP 200 `application/zip`**, bundle =
`IMG_5127.jpg` (309 KB original) + `IMG_5127.amadocs.json` (1.3 KB). Sidecar carried the correct
moondream caption, the OCR text, sharp image facts, and **real parsed EXIF** (`Software: Google`,
`DateTimeOriginal: 2025-11-22`) — confirming `exifr` reads genuine camera metadata. Standalone
zip/unzip round-trip also checked. **Not exercised:** the literal in-browser button click (same
"needs a human eyeball" class as the citation render) — the data path is fully proven via HTTP.

## v2 feature wave (decided 2026-06-13)

Three features, built in this order; packaging stays parked (these slot into the existing
pipeline and don't force a release first). Two packaging deltas to remember when packaging
un-parks: the **vision model** now belongs in the bundle/first-run catalog, and **AI Finder**
will need the **Electron folder picker** (a packaged-app capability).

1. ✅ **Image analyser (vision captioning)** — BUILT 2026-06-13 (see section above).
2. ✅ **OCR quality** — engine-side levers BUILT 2026-06-13 (see "OCR quality" section
   below). The UI **language** picker is **deferred** — build 1 is **English-only** (decided
   2026-06-13), so it's a post-build-1 nicety, not unfinished scope. "Never drop a file" is
   already covered by #1's caption fallback for images.
3. 🅿️ **AI Finder — one-shot folder index** — **PARKED / off the AMAdocs roadmap (2026-06-14,
   user's call: "too many pitfalls").** Not deferred-behind-build-1 anymore — dropped from this
   project. The lock-up/OOM risk, the idle-aware + durable-queue machinery, and the entanglement
   with heavy on-device inference (even on a GPU) make it a different problem shape than AMAdocs' focused
   drop-and-ask tool; if revisited it should be its own product. The settled design below is kept
   as the starting point for whenever/wherever it resumes.

## AI Finder (#3) — settled design (2026-06-13; PARKED 2026-06-14, not built)

**Guiding principle: cautious and responsible — NEVER risk locking up the user's machine,
even at the cost of speed.** For non-technical users a frozen laptop reads as "this app broke
my computer"; that reputation would kill a zero-config product. So folder indexing
*deliberately underperforms* to stay safe. Anything aggressive is a **config-only escape
hatch** for power users (consistent with the config-as-intent stance, [[k-base-modes-direction]]),
never a UI default.

**Seams that exist:** Electron folder picker `dialog.showOpenDialog({properties:["openDirectory"]})`
(+ preload bridge; Electron-only, won't run in the browser dev stack); per-file ingest via the
proven upload-and-embed path (parse→OCR→vision-caption→originals-retain→embed); SSE progress
template = the `pull-model` endpoint (`workspaces.js:1320`); Electron `powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime()`
for idle detection.

**Correction to an earlier note:** in-place ingest is NOT `collectorApi.processDocument` +
absolutePath — `processDocument` (`collectorApi/index.js:111`) hits `/process` off the hotdir and
takes no absolutePath. The absolutePath seam is `parseDocument` (`:331`, hits `/parse`), which
*parses without processing* and **bypasses the originals-retention path the citation→viewer loop
depends on**. So v1 leans **copy-into-Library** (reuse the normal drop path per file): consistent
with the existing "AMAdocs keeps its own private copy" model, keeps citations/vision working;
cost is disk duplication. In-place is a later optimization if big folders make duplication hurt.

**Safe-by-default execution (the whole point):**
- **Strictly serial** — one file in flight, ever. Never parallelize.
- **Durable per-file checkpoint queue** — process one file → embed → commit `done` → next.
  Crash/force-quit mid-file just re-runs that one file on resume (idempotent: content-digest
  vector-cache skips the rest instantly). Survives app close (background indexing spans sessions).
  Needs a small job table (folder, filepath, status pending/done/failed, timestamps).
- **Idle-aware (the honest "background")** — throttling alone does NOT fix lock-up: each vision/OCR
  call is an indivisible GPU/CPU burst, so spacing files just spreads the spikes. The real fix is
  to process only when the user is away (idle > ~30–60s via `powerMonitor`) and auto-pause the
  instant input resumes — how Spotlight/Windows Search get away with it. Plus a cool-down between
  files so nothing stays pinned.
- **Memory/VRAM guard** — the real crash vector (3.5GB GPU + vision + chat model can OOM; huge PDF
  spikes RAM). Per-file size cap (skip + report oversized), don't start next file on low headroom.
- **Per-file watchdog** — a hung caption/OCR past a timeout → skip + report, don't wedge the run.
- **Never blocks the app** — user can keep searching already-indexed docs while the rest trickles in.
- **Pause semantics** = finish current file, then stop (don't abort mid-Ollama-call → no partial
  state). Progress + pause/resume live as an **in-chat status bubble** (`addSystemMsg`, see
  [[k-base-status-feedback]]), not floating chrome.
- **Up-front expectation** — scan first, show a by-type tally + plain warning ("92 files incl. 40
  images; images are AI-described, the slow part; this may take a while — pause anytime"). During:
  a **running ETA** that refines from observed per-file timing (honest, vs a static guess).

**v1 scope:** one safe mode in the UI (no "Fast" footgun); idle-aware + durable queue + pause +
guards. Aggressive/full-speed = config escape hatch only. Whole-drive and live file-watcher stay
out. Even on a GPU, a big image folder is the worst case this design protects against
(sustained vision inference pinning the machine).

## Next steps

1. Package: `electron-builder` → **AppImage BUILT & verified end-to-end (2026-06-14)** —
   boots offline, ingest + vision + chat all work. Full status + the two non-obvious fixes
   in **`PACKAGING.md`**: (a) ⚠️ Ollama needs its whole `lib/ollama/` runtime
   (`llama-server` + GPU/CPU libs, ~2.1 GB) bundled, not just the binary, or all inference
   404s; (b) the collector's `hotdir`/`tmp` must be relocated to writable `userData` (it
   runs from the read-only mount). Proactive first-run model download ✅ **BUILT (2026-06-14)**
   — a "Welcome to AMAdocs" setup overlay pulls the AI (+ opt-in vision) over the `pull-model`
   SSE before first use (shared `streamModelPull()` helper; see `PACKAGING.md`). Node-18 EOL
   exit ✅ **DONE (migrated to Node 22, AppImage rebuilt + verified end-to-end, 2026-06-14)**.
   Still open: icon, Windows/macOS builds. (API session token ✅ BUILT
   2026-06-14 — per-boot token gate on every `/api` request; see `PACKAGING.md`.
   Collector :8888 auth is the remaining open piece, internal-only/lower-risk.)
2. UI polish: collections switcher, About/Licenses screen. *(Concise answers: DONE — settled
   as a hard ~120-word cap, not a toggle; see "Custom changes" → answer-length cap.)*
   - ⬜ **Chat avatars: show text labels "AI" / "ME", not icons.** Today `addMessage`
     renders `🙂` (user) and `A` (assistant) in the `.av` circle (`amadocs-ui/index.html`,
     `addMessage`). Swap to the literal text "ME" / "AI". Minor: tighten `.av` font-size so
     two characters fit the 30px circle. *(requested 2026-06-13, not started)*
   - **Image viewer: metadata under the image + mouse zoom.** *(requested 2026-06-13.)*
     - ✅ **Caption + OCR panel under the image — BUILT 2026-06-13.** `renderImage()` now calls
       `loadImageMeta()` (`amadocs-ui/index.html` → synced to desktop): fetches `doc-view`, splits
       the combined `pageContent` on the `Image description:` / `Text found in image:` markers via
       `sliceSection()`, and renders a `.vmeta` panel (`🖼️ AI description` + `🔤 Text found in
       image`) beneath the `<img>`. Best-effort (fetch/parse failure leaves the image as-is) and
       race-guarded (ignores a late fetch if the user switched docs). Parsing unit-tested (both /
       caption-only / ocr-only / non-image → empty). **Not yet eyeballed live in the UI.**
     - ⬜ **EXIF/source facts (stretch).** NOT in `doc-view` — computed only inside the
       `doc-export` zip route (`exifr` + `sharp`). Add a light JSON variant (e.g.
       `doc-export?format=json` returning just the sidecar object, reusing the same extraction)
       and append a third `.vmeta` section. *(deferred to next session)*
     - ⬜ **Mouse zoom/pan on `.vimg`.** Pure UI: wheel → CSS `transform: scale()` with
       `transform-origin` at the cursor, drag-to-pan when zoomed, double-click/Esc to reset.
       Scope to the image viewer only (don't touch the PDF canvas path). No engine change.
       *(deferred to next session)*
3. ✅ **Generate `LICENSE` (MIT) + `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` — DONE (2026-06-14).** Both at repo
   root + bundled via electron-builder `extraResources`; regen with
   `node tooling/gen-third-party-licenses.js`. Audited clean (all permissive, no copyleft). See
   `PACKAGING.md`.
4. GitHub repo + releases + download page. *(parked)*
5. Cross-platform builds (Windows/macOS) — need those OSes or CI runners.
