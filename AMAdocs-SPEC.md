# AMAdocs — Product Spec: Semantic File Manager

> The canonical product spec. Overview in `K-base.md`; engineering log in `AMAdocs-DEV-NOTES.md`.

## The idea in one sentence

Don't ask users to bring files to the app — go to the files instead. A file manager that
already understands what's in everything.

The browser is the primary interface; the AI is infrastructure. You browse the real
filesystem, and the AI catalogs, summarises, and answers questions about what you select.

### Left panel — File tree

- Real filesystem, rooted at Home by default. Drives shown as top-level nodes.
- Folders expand/collapse in the tree.
- **Left-click file** → preview opens in middle; AI panel shows that file's summary + chat.
- **Left-click folder/drive** → middle shows folder contents (grid/list); AI chat scopes to
  that folder.
- **Right-click** → contextual menu (see below).
- Visual status indicators per file: small icon overlay for indexed / unindexed / image-not-yet-analysed.

### Middle panel — Content area (two modes)

**Folder mode** (when a folder is selected in the tree):
- Grid or list of files, like a real file manager.
- Shows file icon, name, modified date, size.
- Indexed files show their `aiSummary` as a subtitle/tooltip.
- Clicking a file in this view opens it in preview mode (adds a tab).

**Preview mode** (when a file is selected):
- Tabbed — multiple files can be open simultaneously.
- Supported previews: PDF (PDF.js), images (image viewer + AI caption/OCR panel beneath),
  text/Markdown (text view), extracted text for Office/audio.
- **Preview is decoupled from indexing** (as of 2026-06-21): any local file previews straight
  from disk via the `window.amadocs.readFile` bridge, indexed or not — preview = "let me see it";
  indexing (caption/OCR/search) stays opt-in. The engine-backed extras (citation jump-to-page, the
  image caption/OCR panel, the "extracted text the AI reads" view) still require the file to be indexed.
- Unsupported types: show file icon + metadata panel (size, type, modified date, any
  LocalSearch-extracted text, aiSummary if available). Never a blank error — always something useful.

### Right panel — AI panel

Three states depending on selection:

**File selected:**
1. File metadata header (name, type, size, modified)
2. `aiSummary` card — auto-shown, generated on first selection if not cached. Shows spinner
   while generating. For unanalysed images: "Right-click → Analyse with AI to make this
   image searchable."
3. Chat input + conversation, scoped to that file. Uses LocalSearch-extracted text (or
   embedding retrieval for large files) as context. Returns answers with passage citations.

**Folder/drive selected:**
1. Folder metadata (file count, indexed count, pending count)
2. Chat input + conversation, scoped to that folder. Returns **files as results** (not a
   synthesised answer) with snippets. Clicking a result opens the file in preview mode.

**Nothing selected:**
1. Brief explainer: "Select a file to see its summary. Ask a question to search your files."
2. Chat input — searches the whole indexed filesystem.

### Top bar

- **Nav buttons (top-left): ⌂ Home / ‹ Back / › Forward.** Home opens the Homepage (below); Back/Forward
  walk a browser-style history over the middle panel's destinations (Home / folder / file). Built 2026-06-21
  (replaced the old decorative window-style dots) — see `AMAdocs-DEV-NOTES.md`.
- Simple filename / keyword search (TinySPARQL FTS — instant, no LLM, no embeddings).
- Separate from the AI chat. Answers the "find file named X" question; AI chat answers
  the "find files about X" question. Two distinct modes, clearly labelled.

### Homepage (the launch surface)

The app opens to a **Homepage** in the middle panel — the place we lean on to inform the user and offer
options, instead of cramming everything into menus. The ⌂ Home button always returns here. **v1 (lean,
2026-06-21):** a hero (name · version · tagline), a status-card grid (Index / Library / Model / Engine),
an indexed-folders list, and Quick actions (Browse my files · Index a folder… · Refresh). Fed by the
`/amadocs-status` endpoint's structured `data` (which also still writes the on-disk `AMADOCS-STATUS.md`).
Designed to grow: indexing progress + STOP on the Index card, a model picker on the Model card, per-folder
re-index/remove, onboarding.

## Right-click menu

```
📄 any-file.pdf
├ 🔍 Analyse with AI      (OCR + vision caption — primary for images/scanned docs;
│                          available on all files as a "force re-analyse" option)
├ 🧠 Summarise            (generate or refresh aiSummary via LLM)
├ ⬆️  Prioritise           (move to front of background indexing queue)
├ 💾 Save copy with AI notes  (export file copy with summary/OCR/caption embedded
│                              as XMP metadata)
└ 📂 Show in file manager  (reveal in Nautilus)
```

Images and unanalysed files: "Analyse with AI" is shown more prominently (first item,
different icon) since without it they are invisible to the AI.

---

## AI database — local, separate from files

**LanceDB** holds all AI-generated data, keyed by file path:
- Embeddings (vectors for semantic search)
- `aiSummary` (the ~120-word catalog card)
- OCR extracted text (for scanned docs / images)
- Vision captions (moondream descriptions of images)
- Index status and mtime (for incremental sync)

**Files are never modified.** The "Save copy with AI notes" right-click option is the
only path that writes AI data into a file — and it writes a copy, not the original.

---

## Initial setup

On first launch (or when a new drive/folder is added), a one-shot indexing pass runs. It is
presented as **one honest onboarding moment** — "AMAdocs is building your search index" — not
a piecemeal drip-feed. Under the hood it runs in two phases:

**Embedding pass (fast: minutes to ~1 hour depending on corpus size)**
- Reads LocalSearch-extracted text for all indexed files (no LLM, no Ollama).
- Computes embeddings using the native ONNX embedder (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
- Writes to LanceDB. Semantic search is available after this phase.
- Safe queue: serial, cool-downs, durable, hard STOP — THE #1 RULE applies.

**Summary generation (slower: hours, background)**
- Runs the LLM (granite4.1:3b) to generate `aiSummary` per file.
- Strictly serial, cool-downs, pauses when machine is active (idle-aware).
- Summaries fill in progressively; the AI panel shows a spinner for unsummarised files.

**Images and scanned docs:** excluded from both auto-phases. On-demand only via
right-click "Analyse with AI". Rationale: vision inference is heavy; auto-running
moondream on 10,000 photos would violate THE #1 RULE.

**After setup:** incremental maintenance. GNOME LocalSearch's inotify monitoring detects
new/changed/deleted files. The gnome-sync delta path re-embeds only what changed. Cost
scales with changes, not corpus size.

---

## Reused engine components

The AMAdocs engine and its proven components are reused directly under the file-manager shell:

- **TinySPARQL bridge + gnome-sync** — the indexing backbone. `POST /gnome-sync` is the embed
  trigger; the file tree makes the folder the natural unit of organisation.
- **Safe ingest queue** — serial worker, cool-downs (EMBED_COOLDOWN_MS), hard STOP
  (stopAll / stopWorkspace), durable finalize-on-confirm, bounded batches + remaining.
- **All file viewers** — PDF.js, image viewer + caption/OCR panel, text view.
- **Grounded citation loop** — chunk → page → passage highlight. The differentiator; "jump to
  where in the document this came from" is even more natural in a finder context.
- **aiSummary** — generation, caching, on-demand refresh. Shown in the right panel automatically.
- **Vision captioning (moondream)** — right-click "Analyse with AI" on images.
- **OCR** — same, for scanned docs.
- **LanceDB embeddings + semantic retrieval** — scope filter (`sourcePath` / `filterIdentifiers`)
  drives the folder-scoped chat path.
- **API auth token gate**, **session scoping**, **`stripScaffolding()` + `capAnswer()`**.

## New UI build

- **File tree component** — real filesystem tree, left panel.
- **Folder browser view** — middle panel mode 1, with metadata + summary subtitles.
- **File preview tabs** — middle panel mode 2, reusing existing viewers.
- **Right panel: summary card + scoped chat.**
- **Top search bar** — TinySPARQL FTS, separate from AI chat.
- **Onboarding screen** — one honest progress moment for initial indexing.
- **Background indexing cadence scheduler** — resumes pending work on relaunch, runs summary
  generation as a low-priority background task.
- **Chat result mode: files** — folder scope returns file links + snippets, not a synthesised answer.

## Resolved design decisions

1. **One global workspace (`amadocs-library`).** Folder-level scoping is a `sourcePath` path
   filter in LanceDB queries — not separate tables. Per-folder workspaces rejected as
   unnecessary complexity.

2. **One doc producer (gnome-sync).** Because everything flows through the gnome-sync path,
   the earlier mixed-schema LanceDB problem is moot. (The schema bug was also fixed directly
   via `withAmadocsSchema()` — see DEV-NOTES.)

## Open questions

1. **Existing data migration.** If anyone is running an older drop-zone collection, it doesn't
   map to the folder-tree model. Likely: a migration note in the release; old LanceDB data stays
   queryable but is no longer surfaced the old way.

2. ✅ **The `p.N` citation label for bridged docs** — RESOLVED (2026-06-21) for backstop PDFs.
   `buildDoc` carries `asPDF`'s per-page char ranges through `materializeViaCollector`, so
   collector-backstop PDFs (scanned/OCR/empty-text) get `p.N` labels; GNOME-text PDFs stay label-less
   by design (would require re-parsing every PDF). Verified live on the 83-page scanned "Year 6 ICT"
   book (chips `p.11`/`p.18`). See DEV-NOTES.

3. **Name.** AMAdocs is the working name; "Finder++" was a candidate. To be decided before
   public release.
